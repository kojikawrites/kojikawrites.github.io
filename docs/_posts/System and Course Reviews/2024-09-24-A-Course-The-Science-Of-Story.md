### My Thoughts:
The introductory five minute and thirty-five-second video consists of some blonde woman tooting her own horn about how people were “blown away” by this “method”. We shall see. I seriously doubt that I will be blown away by anything this woman with a Karen haircut has to say. I am halfway through this video, not even the meat and potatoes of the course, and she’s talking in this monotone, almost hypnotizing voice. It’s creepy, I don’t like it, and I sincerely hope that she’s not going to use that tone for the entirety of the course, as it will become very annoying, very quickly.

At minute two, she’s talking about how everything aside from this course is “pervasive” and will have to be “unlearned”. Who does she think she is? Does she seriously think that I’m going to listen to this one hour and thirty-seven minute course and suddenly become the next J.K. Rowling or Stephen King? I HIGHLY doubt it. Also at minute two, she’s talking about how “after this course, you’ll never see stories the same way again”. I keep thinking that if it’s too good to be true, it is often just that. I can already tell that she loves the sound of her own voice and thinks she’s the smartest woman in the room. Holy narcissist, Batman… Okay, the other thing that is super annoying about this woman: she keeps changing camera angles from front facing to side, as if she’s speaking to someone else. The words keep echoing in my head. I hope she doesn’t do this during the whole hour of this already boring course…

Okay, the intro video has concluded and I already see my first red flag. She has no fiction book trail on Amazon or GoodReads. If she hasn’t published anything, how can I believe for one second that she’s going to teach me anything writing-related?

Moving on to the meat and potatoes. Let’s see how many red flags I can collect in this fifteen-minute video, shall we?

Well, I am fifty-five seconds in, and she’s using absurd words such as “experientially”. Flowery language like this makes me think that ChatGPT wrote the script for this course.

Okay, I am two minutes in, and she’s talking about The Hero’s Journey. This is SUPER basic material. Anyone who is avidly seeking information on story structure can find it in a fifteen-second Google search. It certainly isn’t worth $300. Also, what’s with the kitchen talk? She’s literally comparing writing a story to baking cookies. It’s annoying.

Okay, I have finished the first video, and it could have been summed up in a five-second Google search about story structure or story outline. None of this is novel or exciting. It’s as basic as a pumpkin spice latte.

Moving on!

The third video… I’m already bored, and she opens with more basic structure. ANYONE who wants to write a novel KNOWS what the Inciting Incident is. I’M SO BORED! Yet, she expects us to give her $300 for this shit.

Okay, in a nutshell, this woman took twenty-one minutes of my life to tediously explain the Try/Fail Cycle… BASIC KINDERGARTEN SHIT!

I wish this was over, but alas, I have four more videos to watch…

On to the fourth video…

I did not understand anything in this video. She was talking about music videos (LITERALLY EIGHT MINUTES OF THE VIDEO WAS A MUSIC VIDEO) and sugar and spice of a story. Honestly, she was so back and forth and disjointed that nothing in video four has anything to do with writing a story… and I just wasted fourteen minutes of my life on this bullshit.

MOVING ON!

Video number five… I just want this to be over with already…

This video is all about context expansion and new neural pathways with way too many references to a blue or red pill. It was boring and didn’t really give any useful information on writing.

Let’s get to the home stretch…

I am going to condense this down to its barest of bones. You don’t have a story if you don’t have emotion and conflict. That’s it. That was the only gem inside this video.

THE LAST VIDEO!  
IT WAS AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR ANOTHER ONE OF HER $495 COURSES! SO GROSS!

Okay, well there you go, we are done… I wouldn’t necessarily call this a scam, however, it was extremely low effort and is in no way worth $300.

# DO NOT BUY THIS COURSE!!!!!
