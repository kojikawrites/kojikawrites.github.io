This particular outline is designed to be integrated into an already existing outline.

Hubris - Hubris is fancy little word that insinuates that the protagonist is a little full of themselves.

Hamartia - Hamartia is an Ancient Greek word that means "to miss the mark" or "to err". In layman’s terms, it means that there’s a critical flaw present that is causing the protagonist’s downfall (temporarily or permanently speaking).

Peripeteia - Hamartia is an Ancient Greek word that means "to miss the mark" or "to err". In layman’s terms, it means that there’s a critical flaw present that is causing the protagonist’s downfall (temporarily or permanently speaking).

Anagnorisis - Yet another one of Aristotle’s words. This one describes the act of the protagonist making a critical discovery. This could include a principal character recognizing or discovering another character's true identity, discovering the true nature of their own circumstances, or finding a tangible object that is somehow crucial to the story.

Nemesis - You may be more familiar with this thought. The fact that a protagonist should always have a nemesis, or some kind of punishment that they can’t avoid.

Catharsis - This is another more familiar Ancient Greek word. This word insinuates that the ending of your story provides a process of releasing, and thereby providing relief from, strong or repressed emotions.
