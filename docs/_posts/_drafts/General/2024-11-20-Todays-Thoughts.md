title:  "Today's Thoughts"
description: In this daily reflection post, I share both the challenges and bright moments of my day. Despite dealing with chronic pain, late starts, and worried moments, I found joy in unexpected places - like some meaningful progress with my work. I'm learning to acknowledge both the ups and downs, celebrating small victories like posting content even when I don't feel like doing it. This kind of honest daily check-in helps me stay grounded and might become a regular feature of my blog.

## My Positives:
My website is now live.  
I am eager to get back into posting.  
I slept well last night.  
My husband allowed me to get a few extra hours of sleep this morning.  
I feel good enough to HOPEFULLY post everything on my list today.  
I am giving myself grace if I don't end up posting everything that I set out to post today.  
I am working on a HUGE review of a pay walled writing website.  

## My Negatives:
I wasn't able to post anything yesterday, as I was recovering from surgery.  
I am angry at the doctors that performed my surgery yesterday, as they only accomplished half of what they were supposed to do.  
I don't feel like eating anything.

## My Thoughts on Today:
Despite the cluster-fuck that was yesterday, I am overall in a good mood today. Pain is at the forefront, BUT that is to be expected after a surgery. Here's to tomorrow being as good as today or better. Oh yeah, and once again, FUCK CANCER...
