For the longest time, I've had a rather lofty goal. I want to create a website for my kids. I've had the domain reserved for a while now, but I haven't done anything with it. It was a domain where a buddy of mine intended to create a naughty site, but he never did - which is fortunate, since that means it hasn't been listed on any filter blacklists. That was the only time I've ever paid for a domain name (beyond the typical registration fees).

![My Girls]({{ "/assets/images/blog/my-girls-2009.jpg" | relative_url }})

What's the domain? I'm glad you asked! It's `girlsatplay.com`. There's not much there now. It's a placeholder that has very little resemblance to my vision for it.
