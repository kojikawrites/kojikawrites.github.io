## From the Back of the Book:
## Working Title:
Earth Ship

## Story Synopsis:
The year is 2954. After many decades of environmental decline, humanity has finally achieved the unthinkable - technology capable of artificially maintaining Earth's atmosphere and temperature no matter where in the universe the planet is located. No longer dependent on the Sun's warmth and light, the Earth itself has been transformed into a colossal spaceship, ready to voyage into the cosmic unknown. Brilliant scientist Dr. Avigayil Gray has been appointed Captain of the Earth Ship. Though ambitious and headstrong, Avigayil's controversial ideas of planetary migration have won her few friends among the mission's scientists and engineers. Her most vocal critic is renowned astrophysicist Dr. Vikram Milovanović, who believes that tampering with the Earth's natural relationship with the Sun is at best, reckless narcissism and at worst, dangerous hubris. As the launch date nears, Avigayil and Vikram's professional antagonism erupts into a passionate argument and discontinue their working relationship. Launch day goes off without a hitch and months later, they had cleared the Milky Way. Things continue to progress nicely for the next sixteen-months. However, on the seventeenth-month of the journey, a catastrophic systems failure causes a radiation leak and utter chaos, as the Earth Ship is hurtled off-course into uncharted space. Cut off from the Sun and lost in the void, the planet's artificial life support begins to steadily fail. As food and water supplies dwindle, Avigayil and Vikram must put aside their differences to find a way to save the Earth ship. Desperate, they initiate an experimental procedure, channeling the Earth's internal heat to repower the engines and get critical support systems back online. The maneuver is successful, but has an unforeseen side effect, as the planet's molten core becomes dangerously unstable. With worldwide volcanic eruptions and tectonic shifts imminent, society descends into chaos. Avigayil and Vikram, having no time to restore the Earth to its original orbit, they decide to attempt to find a habitable planet to settle before the end comes for them all. With annihilation looming, Avigayil comes to realize that her faith in science alone is not enough. If humanity is to survive, the wisdom of Vikram and others must balance her own relentless ambition. In this crucible among the stars, Avigayil and Vikram find that only together can they pilot the Earth Ship to safety and forge a hopeful future for humankind.
