title:  "FtBotB - A Post Apocalyptic Novel"
description: I've developed a post-apocalyptic story that pairs an unlikely duo - a social media-obsessed teenager and a grizzled survivalist - in the aftermath of catastrophic solar flares. Through Ayres Jorge and Ozman Shaugh's journey, I explore how different generations and mindsets might adapt to survive in a world stripped of technology. As they face various threats, from looters to warlords, their complementary skills and perspectives help them not only survive but eventually lead others in rebuilding society. The narrative challenges the typical "hunker down and defend" approach of survival stories, suggesting that true hope lies in bringing people together rather than hiding from them.

The Surge

## Story Synopsis:
It's the near future, and seventeen-year-old Ayres Jorge is like any other teenager - glued to her phone, obsessed with social media, and struggling to connect with her disconnected parents. That all changes in an instant when a series of massive solar flares knock out nearly all of the electronics on the planet. Planes fall from the sky, cars careen out of control, and societal order spirals into panicked chaos overnight. Terrified, Ayres flees her suburban home to seek refuge at her secret spot in the wilderness. There, she crosses paths with grizzled survivalist Ozman Shaugh. He's been preparing for this doomsday scenario his whole life and knows they need to get as far away from the population centers as humanly possible. Though from completely different worlds, Ayres' teen savviness seems to complement Ozman's earthy ruggedness, and they strike up an unlikely alliance to face this brave new world together. As they trek across the country in search of the perfect isolated refuge, Ayres and Ozman encounter the very worst of humanity emerging from the wreckage - roving bands of violent looters and aggressively territorial warlords staking their claims in the post-apocalyptic world. Ayres wants to ignore the signs of rising danger, but Ozman knows they can't just hide away while society descends further into lawless chaos. Through their travels, he teaches Ayres survival skills while she helps him realize they can't surrender all hope for the future of humanity. When the pair finally reaches Ozman's bunker, they discover a group of families have already claimed it as their own. The ruthless band is led by Einar Willis, who will let nothing compromise the security of his new empire - including Ayres and Ozman. A dangerous battle of wits emerges as our duo tries to take back the bunker through strategic trickery, rather than violence. Just when they succeed, a major threat looms - an aggressive warlord named Rein Dareios has been busy conquering the region, conscripting survivors into his growing army. He sees their bunker as a strategic resource to expand his burgeoning empire. Ozman wants to hunker down and defend their position, but Ayres convinces him they can't just think small-scale anymore. If they want to restore any semblance of order and progress for the future, they will have to go on the offensive, against Einar and Rein. Begrudgingly, with Ayres’ prodding, Ozman agrees to temporarily team up with Einar and trains the homestead families in rudimentary combat. During the final battle, Rein underestimates the cunning of Ayres and Ozman’s motley militia. Their group overcomes Rein’s people through clever sabotage and outsmarting brute force. With Rein defeated, Ozman comes to realize Ayres was right, they can't just hide away and wait for things to get better. If they want to rebuild society from the ashes, they’ll have to lead the way. Together, the unlikely duo forge a new path into the uncertain future, proving that humanity's darkest days can reveal hidden reserves of strength and hope when brave souls come together and step up to confront the darkness.
