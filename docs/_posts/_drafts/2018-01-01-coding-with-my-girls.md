My youngest, Mary Frances, has expressed an interest in learning my trade. And my middle kid, Abigail, has asked me to teach a programming class for her this coming semester. We've home-schooled all three girls. The better half is a certified teacher (high school Math) and has driven things since day one, with me stepping in for help in writing and art. It's my turn to step up and take on a class or two.

The eldest, Zoe, has landed on a career path that involves pets and pet health. She's 18 now, and started her first job a few weeks ago. That job is in an unrelated field, but it's a great first step into adulthood, and I've very proud of her for taking that step.
