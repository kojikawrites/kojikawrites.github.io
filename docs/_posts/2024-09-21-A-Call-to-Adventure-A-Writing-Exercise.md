# A Call to Adventure:

When your character embarks on their journey, their familiar routines and surroundings are slowly left behind.

They're then thrust into unfamiliar terrain, where they must navigate novel environments and interact with a cast of new and intriguing characters, not all of which will be the friendliest. This departure from the ordinary is a crucial element of their adventure, for it propels them out of their comfort zone, setting the stage for personal growth and transformation, often leading to profound character development.

A change of setting provides a storytelling opportunity to shift the very fabric of your narrative world. Everything from the climate and landscape to the local dialect and attire can be transformed. Imagine transplanting a Viking from the rugged Nordic fjords to the sun-soaked shores of Australia or transporting a towering Wookiee from the forests of Kashyyyk to the mysterious swamps of Dagobah. These changes in locale not only offer visual and sensory diversity, but also serve as powerful tools for evolving the plot and enhancing the overall narrative.

Incorporating a new location into your story should not merely be a change of scenery; it should introduce fresh challenges and obstacles that test the limits of your character's capabilities. The character remains the same character with their core values and qualities intact, but the absence of their familiar routines forces them to adapt, learn, and grow in unexpected ways. It's through these trials and tribulations in a foreign setting that the character's true mettle is revealed, and their journey takes on a transformative arc that captivates the audience and keeps them eagerly turning the pages.

## The Exercise:

### Consider the Following Questions:
- In the past, did your character travel someplace particularly important to them?
- Is there a compelling reason to go back now?
- How would the character react to a setting that challenges their beliefs?
- How would the character react to a setting that forces them to confront their past?
- What drives them to venture into the unfamiliar?
- Is it a quest for knowledge, a pursuit of a personal goal, or a call to adventure?

### Dialogue Work:
If your character could call home, who would they call and what would they say? Now, write a short dialogue where the character actually makes this hypothetical phone call.

### Leaving Town:
List five reasons why your character might need to leave town right now.
Brainstorm four new settings, upon leaving town, that would be challenging for your character to navigate.
Consider settings that not only challenge the character physically but also emotionally or morally.
Too, think about how supporting characters in each new setting can both aid and hinder the character's progress.

It Might be helpful to structure it in the following way:
- The New Setting:
- The Supporting Characters Involved:
- How They Help the Protagonist:
- How They Hinder the Protagonist:

Now, briefly explain how each new setting's challenge aligns with the character's personal growth or transformation. This can help you see the connection between your setting and character development more clearly.
