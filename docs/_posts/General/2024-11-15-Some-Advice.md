description: I reflect on the unique value of being a beginner in your craft. While many rush to move beyond this stage as soon as challenges arise, I emphasize how the early learning phase offers special opportunities for growth and development that become rarer as you advance. I encourage writers to embrace and appreciate their beginner status, as each new level of mastery makes transformative growth spurts increasingly difficult to achieve.

Stop for a moment and enjoy being a beginner.

Do everything in your power to soak it all up.

Because I promise you this, the higher you climb, the more successful you get, the harder it gets to feel your next growth spurt.

After all, being a beginner is easy. That's why everyone wants to pick something different as soon as things start to even remotely get hard.
