Talk to any author, and they'll tell you that they have a tool box curated for their individual writing needs.
I too, have a toolbox, and if I had to pick one of my favorite tools in my toolbox, it would hands down, have to be Scrivener. It is a writing program that provides me with everything I need to get the job done.

Note: Scrivener has somewhat of a steep learning curve if you're wanting to utilize every aspect of the program.

My advice to the novice writer, use only what you absolutely need in the beginning and take your time to learn the ins and outs of Scrivener.
