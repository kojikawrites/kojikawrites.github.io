description: After a four-day hiatus due to health issues that made posting feel overwhelming, I'm finally feeling well enough to get back to writing. Sometimes we need to listen to our bodies and take breaks, but now I'm ready to resume sharing content with you all.

It's been four days... and I haven't posted anything.

I haven't felt well and posting felt daunting, so I didn't do it. Now, however, I am feeling a bit better, so I am going to attempt to post.
