title:  "I'm So Sorry"
description: While I wasn't able to complete today's planned course review, I've discovered a promising "writing better scenes" course that runs about four and a half hours. I'm planning to dive into it tonight and finish up tomorrow morning, so I should have a thorough review ready for you soon. Thanks for your patience as I work on maintaining a consistent reviewing schedule.

I apologize, sadly I won't be bringing you a course or book review today. I have found a four and a half hour "writing better scenes" course though, that I will hopefully be reviewing tomorrow (I'll try to listen to a good portion of it tonight and then the last bit tomorrow morning). Please bare with me as I work out these scheduling issues. I'll have something for you tomorrow, I hope.
