title:  "Time Constraints"
description: Today was dedicated to behind-the-scenes work - fixing formatting issues and improving descriptions across my older posts rather than creating new content. While this means I won't meet my usual posting goals, these updates were necessary to improve the overall quality of the blog. I should be back to regular posting tomorrow, once all these edits are properly in place.

I hate behind-the-scenes days. Most of the time it's tedious and boring as fuck. All you do is fix shit.
