title:  "Seventy-Seven Individual Character Archetypes"
description: I've compiled a comprehensive list of 77 character archetypes that go well beyond the basic hero-villain dynamics. From the Rogue with a Heart of Gold to the Forgotten Chronicler, each archetype comes with a detailed description and a well-known example from literature, film, or television. Whether you're writing a dashing Han Solo-type scoundrel or a brooding Ned Stark-style defender of lost causes, these archetypes can serve as foundational building blocks for creating complex, memorable characters. While these aren't rigid templates, they provide useful starting points for character development.
