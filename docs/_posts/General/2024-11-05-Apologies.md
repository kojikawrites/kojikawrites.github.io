description: After a multi-day hiatus due to health issues that made posting feel overwhelming, I'm finally feeling well enough to get back to writing. Sometimes we need to listen to our bodies and take breaks, but now I'm ready to resume sharing content with you all.

I apologize for missing so many days that I would have spent posting some good content for you. I will try to be back tomorrow to make up from the last four days.

Tomorrow we will likely have a new President. So, things will either be wonderful or very shitty.
