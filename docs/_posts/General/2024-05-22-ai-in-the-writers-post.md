title:  "Is AI a Threat to the Writer's Sphere?"
description: |
  I explore why AI isn't the main threat to writers today – instead, it's the overwhelming number of authors competing 
  for limited attention. While my own novels remain unpublished, I've identified an opportunity in helping other 
  writers achieve their publishing goals through digital content and courses. Rather than viewing this as giving up on 
  fiction, I see it as a path that could eventually enable both my writing and teaching aspirations.

The short answer is no, and the long answer remains no.

While many of us worry about AI as a potential threat to our writing careers, the real challenge we face right now is the sheer number of authors writing and publishing. With so many of us competing for limited recognition and significance, AI isn’t our primary concern at this moment.
&nbsp;
## The real question we need to ask is:
How can we make our individual writing stand out in a market where the supply exceeds the demand?

Currently, many independent authors juggle multiple day jobs just to make ends meet, dreaming of the day they can write full-time. Personally, I could focus on unique perspectives, underserved niches, or building a strong author brand. However, I see an opportunity to generate a better income for my family by helping aspiring writers achieve their publishing goals.

It’s disheartening that my own stories remain unpublished for now, but the reality is that I see countless ads from fellow struggling authors every day, all vying for readers’ attention. On the other hand, there’s a growing demand for digital content, programs, courses, and workshops to assist would-be writers in publishing their books.

For the time being, I’m not overly concerned about AI and remain hopeful that this website will eventually allow me to both sell my novels and support other authors on their writing journeys.

What do you see as your major hurdle or competition? I’d love to hear about your personal experiences, thoughts, and strategies for navigating the challenges of the current writing and publishing landscape. Go ahead and drop me a comment down below.
