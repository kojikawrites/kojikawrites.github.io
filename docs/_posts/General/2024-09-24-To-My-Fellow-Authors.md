title:  "Seeking Grace"
description: While standing on the shoulders of writing giants like Mark Tufo, Stephen King, and Craig DiLouie, I'm sharing my own experiences and insights in hopes they'll connect with fellow writers in meaningful ways. Though the advice I offer may not be revolutionary, sometimes timing is everything - perhaps these words will reach you exactly when you need them. If this blog helps nurture your writing journey or gives you a fresh perspective, even in small ways, I'll consider that a profound success.

My message to fellow authors, I am deeply grateful to the many writers who have shared profound insights about the practice of writing—Mark Tufo, Stephen King, Craig DiLouie, and so many others. Their wisdom and experience far exceed my own, and their words offer such richness. What I humbly offer here may not be entirely new, but I hope that, through some act of grace, it reaches you in a way that resonates with your own journey—through stories that feel familiar, or at a time when your heart is ready for just this message. If these few words contained within this blog provide even a small amount of help, encouragement, or sustenance for your writer’s heart, I will feel truly honored. I sincerely hope that you have found what you need, discovered some things
you didn’t know, and settled a little more deeply into who you are as a writer.
