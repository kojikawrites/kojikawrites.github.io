title:  "My Writing Essentials:"
description: I've compiled my comprehensive list of writing essentials, from hardware to software that I use daily. My toolkit starts with a Macbook Pro and includes a mix of traditional writing tools like Scrivener and innovative AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Sudowrite. I rely on multiple organizational tools including Logseq, Notion, and specialized writing software like NovelCrafter and Dramatica Story Expert. While some might question certain choices (especially the AI tools), each serves a specific purpose in my writing process. I've included direct links to help you explore these tools yourself.

It seems that one of the questions that is most asked is "What is your writing essentials list?".
BLah. Blah. You can finish this.

This is one of the most asked question, it seems. So you're likely wondering what my essentials are.
Well, buckle up, because my list is lengthy.

### My Writing Essentials List:

1. My Macbook Pro is the computer that I use. Don't come for me, but I feel that the Apple environment is easier to work with.
2. The Notes app on my iPhone. I have well over three-hundred notes, all related in some form or fashion to writing.
3. The Persona app (Mariner Software). It is a great character organizer. There's not another app like it.
4. The Scrivener app. This is my main writing tool.
5. ProWritingAid - This is one of only two developmental editors that I'll ever use.
6. AutoCrit - This is the second developmental editor that I use.
7. ChatGPT - I know this is "controversial," now ask me if I give a damn... Newsflash, I don't.
8. Claude - Yes, another AI web UI. If you follow this blog you're going to see me talk about AI a lot.
9. Sudowrite - Once again, AI rears their fabulous head.
10. OpenRouter - It's literally an AI playground and I love exploring the different models. It's so much fun.

12. Logseq - It's a repository for my manuscripts, much like Scrivener.
13. CardBuddy - This app is just a fun repository. It is a bit limited, however.
14. Outline - This app is essentially a place to put all of your work and keep things separate.
15. NovelCrafter - This is a repository for your novels with an AI assistant.
16. Dramatica Story Expert - This si a repository for your novel that allows for quick section work.
17. Bibisco - An all-in-one story mapping program.
18. FirstDraftPro - An all-in-one story creation tool.
19. Curio - A whole novel organizer.
