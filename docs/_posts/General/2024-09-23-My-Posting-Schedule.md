### What to Expect:
It is my hope that I can post content at least five to ten times a day, time and parenting permitting.

It will look somewhat like this, time permitting of course:
1. An Outline (perhaps two, depending on time constraints)
2. The Story Beat of the Day (perhaps two, depending on time constraints)
3. A General Informative Post (perhaps two, depending on time constraints)
4. A Writing Exercise (perhaps two, depending on time constraints)
5. Reviewing a Writing System, Class or Course (so that you don't have to) (perhaps two, depending on time constraints)
6. My "Day in the Life" (only once a day)
7. A Back of the Book Showcase (only once a day)
8. A Writing Prompt (perhaps two, depending on time constraints)
9. A Writing Software Review (only once a day)
10. My Writing Process, Routine and Rituals (only once a day)
11. My Favorite Writer’s Tools Review (perhaps two, depending on time constraints)
12. A Random Book Review (perhaps two, depending on time constraints)
13. A Craft Workshop Post (perhaps two, depending on time constraints)

If there’s a post that you have questions about, or if you’d like to see me post something specific, please don’t hesitate to email me at info@thewriteplace.rocks.
I will be adding my social media accounts at some point in the "Contact Us" section, as well, for communications purposes.
