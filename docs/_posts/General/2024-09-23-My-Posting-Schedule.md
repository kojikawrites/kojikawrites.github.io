title:  "My Posting Schedule (When Possible)"
description: I'm planning an ambitious daily content schedule covering everything from writing exercises and story beats to software reviews and craft workshops. My goal is to share 5-10 posts daily, including outlines, writing prompts, system reviews, and glimpses into my own writing process. Each type of content serves a specific purpose in helping fellow writers develop their craft. While some posts may appear multiple times daily, others like the "Day in the Life" and software reviews will be once-daily features. I welcome suggestions for specific topics through email.

### What to Expect:
It is my hope that I can post content at least five to ten times a day, time and parenting permitting.

It will look somewhat like this, time permitting of course:
1. An Outline (perhaps two, depending on time constraints)
2. The Story Beat of the Day (perhaps two, depending on time constraints)
3. A General Informative Post (perhaps two, depending on time constraints)
4. A Writing Exercise (perhaps two, depending on time constraints)
5. Reviewing a Writing System, Class or Course (so that you don't have to) (perhaps two, depending on time constraints)
6. My "Day in the Life" (only once a day)
7. A Back of the Book Showcase (only once a day)
8. A Writing Prompt (perhaps two, depending on time constraints)
9. A Writing Software Review (only once a day)
10. My Writing Process, Routine and Rituals (only once a day)
11. My Favorite Writer’s Tools Review (perhaps two, depending on time constraints)
12. A Random Book Review (perhaps two, depending on time constraints)
13. A Craft Workshop Post (perhaps two, depending on time constraints)

Note: I know that, that list is large. I will try my best to do them all, but on the off chance that I don't, I hope you'll be kind to me and accept my apologies. I'm only human.

Also, if there’s a post that you have questions about, or if you’d like to see me post something specific, please don’t hesitate to email me at info@thewriteplace.rocks.
I will be adding my social media accounts at some point in the "Contact Us" section, as well, for communications purposes.
