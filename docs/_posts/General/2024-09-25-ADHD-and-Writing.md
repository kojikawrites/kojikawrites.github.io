title:  "Writing with ADHD and my Neuro-Spicy Brain"
description: Recently diagnosed and medicated for ADHD, I'm finally seeing progress in my writing journey. Though I'm sitting on about a thousand unfinished stories (no exaggeration!), I've managed to complete my first children's book and am making headway on a Space Opera that's been demanding attention. While my ADHD fixations haven't quite cracked the code for consistently finishing projects, I'm learning to work with my brain rather than against it. I'm always eager to hear how other writers with ADHD manage their creative process.

## Who doesn't have ADHD these days?
I have a thousand (yes, I said a thousand) or so unfinished stories, all awaiting their turn in the work rotation. Recently I was prescribed medication for my ADHD and it's actually helping. I finished my first children's book and I have now moved forward with my Space Opera story that's been burring a hole in my brain.

I wish my fixations would help me actually finish my stories. I have yet to find the magic that would allow for that, unfortunately. So for now, I will continue to accumulate unfinished stories and work on them to the best of my ability.

Do you have ADHD? What do you do in order to stay focused on your writing? I'd love for you to share your tips, so drop me an email. You will find it on the "Contact Us" page.
