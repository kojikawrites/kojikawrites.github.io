### Not every day can be a total success...

### My Negatives:
Pain!


### My Positives:
I ate food!
Pear juice!

### My Thoughts on Today:
- Waking up late means that I started my work late, but apparently my body needed the rest.
- Pain is an everyday thing with me, but today it was just relentless. Although I did manage to distract myself.
- I'm really proud of the posts that I've done today and the learning of WebStorm is coming along.
- I don't eat much by mouth lately because of the gj kangaroo tube, but today I managed to eat a whole fish sandwich and some fries.

Questions to Consider:
What are your thoughts about today?
What are your negatives regarding today?
What are your positives regarding today?
