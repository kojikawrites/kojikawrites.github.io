title:  "Everyday"
description: In this daily reflection post, I share both the challenges and bright moments of my day. Despite dealing with chronic pain, late starts, and worried moments about my four-year-old's health, I found joy in unexpected places - like a rare "I love you" from my teenager and some meaningful progress with my work. I'm learning to acknowledge both the ups and downs, celebrating small victories like managing to eat a bit more than usual. This kind of honest daily check-in helps me stay grounded and might become a regular feature of my blog.

### My Thoughts on Today:
- Waking up late means that I started my work late, but apparently my body needed the rest.
- Pain is an everyday thing with me, but today it was just relentless. Although I did manage to distract myself.
- I'm really proud of the posts that I've done today and the learning of WebStorm is coming along.
- I don't eat much by mouth lately because of the gj kangaroo tube, but today I managed to eat a whole fish sandwich and some fries.
