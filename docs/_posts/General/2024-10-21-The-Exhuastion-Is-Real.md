title:  "The Exhaustion is Real"
description: After a twenty-day hiatus due to cancer-related exhaustion, I'm pushing through to bring content back to the blog. While the battle with fatigue continues, I'm determined to keep posting - thankfully, I have plenty of material ready to share. I've already managed three posts today and am planning more, including a Beat of the Day, an outline, and a writing system review. The struggle is real, but so is my commitment to keep this blog going.

First things first... I apologize...

It's been some time since I've posted some real content. I apologize, my body has been so tired that simply being awake was a battle. The battle isn't over either. However, I am going to be making a real effort to post through the exhaustion. Luckily for me, I have a lot of ready content to cull from. I've already made three posts today, so I'm doing better than I have been these past twenty days. So, I'm off to do The Beat of the Day, post an outline and look at a writing system to review.

FUCK CANCER!
