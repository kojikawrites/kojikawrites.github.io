title:  "The Beat of the Day - A Care Parcel"
description: I explore the concept of a Care Parcel - a pre-existing relationship that defines and humanizes the protagonist. This storytelling element serves multiple purposes, it helps readers connect emotionally with the main character, reveals their flaws, and establishes what they're willing to fight for. Importantly, I emphasize that this relationship must exist before the story begins to create authentic emotional stakes.
