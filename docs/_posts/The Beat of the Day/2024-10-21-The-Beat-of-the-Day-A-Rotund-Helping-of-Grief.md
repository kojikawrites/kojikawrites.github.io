title:  "The Beat of the Day - A Rotund Helping of Grief"
description: I explore how to incorporate grief into storytelling, examining various forms it can take - from death and relationship dissolution to loss of faith or safety. As a story beat, grief can be used multiple times to build emotional depth. However, I emphasize that writing convincingly about grief requires personal experience with loss, as it's difficult to authentically portray something so profound without having felt it yourself.

I want to talk about grief today. So, both the beat of the day and the outline is going to circle around grief.

### A Rotund Helping of Grief - An Explanation:
Something happens that causes immense grief for the protagonist and his group. This could involve the disillusionment of a relationship, someone physically leaving their group, a negative change of physical, mental, emotional or sexual health, losing something vital to their journey, someone dying, having to leave someplace where they’ve found safety, losing trust in someone, imprisonment, or a loss of faith. This folder can be placed multiple times in the same section or multiple sections, depending on the need too.

### A Warning of sorts:
Grief is something that you will have to have experienced if you are going to write about it. If you have been blessed and have never felt it, you might find it hard to use this story beat properly.

Have you ever experienced a profound loss? Tell me about it. Drop me a comment below.
