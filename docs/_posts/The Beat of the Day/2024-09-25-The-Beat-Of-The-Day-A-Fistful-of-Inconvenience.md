### A Hand Full of Inconvenience:
Swat the protagonist with a fistful of trouble. Hint at a mystery, an adversary or a large problem needing to be solved, something the protagonist has to struggle to cope with. This folder can be placed multiple times in the same section or multiple sections, depending on the need too.

### An Explanation:
I personally love this beat because it enables me to just throw everything at my characters and wait and see who survives it all. How would you use this beat? Drop me an email. I'd love to hear what you would do.

I am willing to bet that you've used this beat more than once in your writing journey. So tell me about your version. Drop me a comment below.
