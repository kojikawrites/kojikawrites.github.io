Secret societies are far more than the stuff of thrillers and suspense novels. They exist in various forms across the spectrum of human organizations, from the well-known and respected, like Alcoholics Anonymous and the Girl Scouts, to the enigmatic and mysterious. Every group, no matter how overt or covert, possesses its unique goals, rituals, and insider knowledge that sets it apart from the rest of the world.

Whether your story's focus is on an ancient and exclusive fraternity, a quirky midnight bowling league that conceals secrets beneath the laughter, or the ominous house down the street emitting eerie sounds at odd hours, secret societies offer your character the tantalizing prospect of stepping into a concealed realm or orchestrating a daring escape from an ongoing nightmare.
