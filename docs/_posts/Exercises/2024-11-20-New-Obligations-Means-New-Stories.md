title:  "New Obligations Means New Stories - An Exercise:"
description: I explore how assigning characters new roles and responsibilities can deepen narratives and drive character development. Through eight key approaches - from transforming lone wolves into leaders to creating strategic role reversals - I demonstrate how changing a character's obligations creates opportunities for growth and conflict. I've included specific questions to help writers think through how new roles might affect their characters' motivations, relationships and story arcs, encouraging exploration of unexpected career paths that challenge characters' existing traits and beliefs.

Empowering your character with a fresh set of roles and obligations can breathe new life into your narrative, offering a rich tapestry of opportunities for character development and plot progression. Whether they assume the mantle of leadership, embark on the most humbling tasks, or take on responsibilities that lie outside their comfort zone, these shifts in status and roles can dramatically reshape the trajectory of your story. Let's explore these concepts in more detail:

1. From Lone Wolf to Team Leader:
   Transitioning your character from a solitary, self-reliant individual to a team leader can be a transformative narrative device. It challenges the character's inherent traits and forces them to adapt to a collaborative role. This shift can reveal aspects of their personality that were previously unexplored.

2. Role Reversals:
   Utilizing role reversals in your narrative adds layers of complexity. Placing a seasoned captain in a position that requires menial labor, like shoveling coal, creates intriguing tension and highlights the character's adaptability and resilience. Conversely, making a character step into a leadership role they had previously rejected raises questions about their motivations and personal growth.

3. Nurturing Responsibilities:
   Assigning your character nurturing responsibilities, such as caring for a baby or a baby elephant, offers unique storytelling opportunities. These obligations not only showcase the character's empathy and compassion but also introduce challenges and dilemmas they must navigate, driving character development and plot dynamics.

4. Revisiting the Past:
   Revisiting a former occupation or role that your character had left behind can unravel a treasure trove of character motivations and story potential. What compels them to return to their old life? What unresolved conflicts or desires are reignited by this decision?

5. New Options and Challenges:
   Introducing fresh obligations opens up new avenues for character growth and storyline complexity. It can trigger a cascade of events, relationships, and conflicts that drive the plot in unexpected directions. These shifts also provide opportunities for your characters to confront their limitations and discover untapped strengths.

6. Playing Strengths Against Weaknesses:
   Incorporate judo-like storytelling by leveraging your character's strengths against them. For instance, placing a highly self-reliant lone wolf in charge of a mission could force them to rely on others and grapple with issues of trust and cooperation. This creates a compelling internal and external conflict.

7. Motivations and Backstories:
   Explore your character's motivations and backstory to understand what might drive them to embrace or reject new obligations. These elements of their past can be pivotal in shaping their decisions and actions throughout the narrative.

8. Plot Evolution:
   The introduction of new responsibilities can act as a catalyst for plot evolution. It propels the story forward, creating turning points and unforeseen challenges that keep readers engaged and invested in the characters' journeys.

Incorporating these narrative elements, such as shifting roles and responsibilities, offers a dynamic framework for character growth and plot development. It compels your characters to confront their limitations, embrace change, and adapt to evolving circumstances, ultimately enhancing the depth and resonance of your storytelling.

The Exercise:
Questions to Consider:
If you were to imagine your character drafting their résumé, what would they list as their career goals?

If your character were to take on a new occupation, what might it be?

What would motivate the character to take on this new role?

Is it out of necessity, a desire for personal growth, or perhaps a specific plot-driven reason?

How would this new obligation affect their relationships, goals, or the overall trajectory of the story?

How does this new role challenge the character's existing beliefs, habits, or goals?

What lessons might they learn along the way?

Would this new obligation lead to new plot developments, alliances, or conflicts?

List three interesting jobs in your world, then brainstorm how your character might fill them. Think about the specific strengths, weaknesses, and personality traits of the character when brainstorming these potential jobs. Consider thinking outside the box and coming up with job options that might initially seem unusual for the character.
