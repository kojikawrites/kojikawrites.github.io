title:  "Character Arc Progression - An Exercise:"
description: This framework is for understanding how character wounds shape story arcs. By examining the relationship between traumatic past events and current behaviors, we can trace how wounds generate fears, false beliefs, and dysfunctional coping mechanisms. I provide targeted questions to help writers identify their characters' basic human needs, motivations, and conflicts that stem from these formative wounds. This flowchart approach helps create more psychologically complex character arcs.

When it comes to poignant character elements, none are quite as formative as the wounding event. It
generates crippling fears, changes the way the character views herself and the world, and spawns unhealthy
coping mechanisms that do more harm than good—all of which results in someone who is stuck in
dysfunction, with contentment and fulfillment perpetually beyond their grasp. This is where your story, and
the character’s arc, begins.  

But what, you might ask, does the wound have to do with character arc? How does it all fit together?
Allow us to introduce the Character Arc Progression tool—a streamlined flowchart that uses the wound and
its aftereffects to help you figure out what basic need your character is missing because of the wounding
event, the story goal they’ll pursue in order to fill that lack, likely sources of conflict to impede their progress,
and much more. Using the questions below, start anywhere on the flowchart and fill in the missing pieces as
you discover them.

Questions to Consider

Outer Motivation: What outer motivation (story goal) is your character pursuing to try and attain her inner
motivation?  

Inner Motivation: Which of the 5 basic human needs is your character missing due to the wounding event
and its aftereffects?  

Physiological: the most basic and primal needs, such as food, water, shelter, sleep, and reproductive
sex.  

Safety and Security: the need to be safe, in good health, and have stability, both for oneself and loved
ones.  

Love and Belonging: tied to human connection and the ability to form lasting bonds, experience
intimacy, feel love, and love others in turn.  

Esteem and Recognition: the need to be valued, appreciated, and recognized by others for one’s
contributions, as well as to achieve higher levels of worthiness, self-respect, and confidence.

Self-Actualization: the need to attain fulfillment through the realization of one’s potential. This might
come in the form of pursuing and achieving meaningful goals, seeking knowledge, attaining spiritual
enlightenment, or embracing core values, beliefs, and an identity so one may live one’s truth.

Outer Conflict: What external forces (people, organizations, natural or supernatural phenomena, etc.) are
blocking your character from achieving her outer motivation?

Inner Conflict: What internal difficulties (doubts, temptations, secrets, moral dilemmas, flaws that thwart
success, opposing desires or goals, etc.) are making it hard for your character to achieve her outer motivation?

The Lie: What dis-empowering and false belief (No one could ever love me; I can’t trust my own instincts;
People are inherently evil, etc.) does the character now embrace because of the wounding event? This could
be a belief about herself, an organization, a certain group of people, or the world at large.

Wound: What traumatic past experience caused the character deep psychological pain that continues to
significantly impair her into the present?

Fear: What specific fear resulted from the wounding event that is now driving the character’s behavior?
