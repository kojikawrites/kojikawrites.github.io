The decision to kill your protagonist in the middle of your story is a bold and impactful narrative choice that can have profound implications for the plot, character development, and thematic exploration. While it's not a decision to be taken lightly, there are scenarios where it can be a great idea. Let's explore the reasons why this might be one of those times:

1. Character Growth and Transformation:
   Killing the protagonist mid-story can provide a unique opportunity for character growth and transformation. It forces other characters to step into leadership roles, confront their own limitations, and adapt to the challenges previously shouldered by the protagonist. This can lead to powerful arcs of personal development and self-discovery.

2. Plot Twists and Unpredictability:
   The death of the protagonist is a dramatic plot twist that can take readers by surprise. This level of unpredictability can keep the story engaging and captivate the audience's attention. It challenges conventional storytelling norms and subverts expectations, making the narrative more memorable.

3. Exploration of Themes:
   The protagonist's death can serve as a vehicle for exploring profound themes such as sacrifice, legacy, mortality, and the enduring impact of one's actions. It invites readers to contemplate the protagonist's legacy and the enduring power of their ideals.

4. Test of Resilience:
   When the protagonist is no longer present to guide and protect, other characters must demonstrate their resilience and resourcefulness. Their ability to carry on the protagonist's mission or values can be a testament to the strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity.

5. Redefining Heroism:
   Killing the protagonist can redefine the concept of heroism within the narrative. It challenges the notion that heroism is confined to a single individual and highlights the collective strength of a group or community coming together to achieve a common goal.

6. Emotional Impact:
   The protagonist's death can evoke powerful emotions in readers and characters alike. Grief, loss, and determination in the face of tragedy can resonate deeply with the audience, creating a strong emotional connection to the story.

7. Compelling Conflict:
   The absence of the protagonist can create compelling conflicts among other characters and adversaries. It can shift the dynamics of power, alliances, and goals, adding layers of complexity to the narrative.

8. Exploration of Indispensability:
   Imagining the protagonist dead is a way to test just how indispensable they are to the story and the world they inhabit. It challenges the notion that the protagonist is irreplaceable and allows the narrative to explore the consequences of their absence.

While killing the protagonist mid-story is a daring narrative choice, it can lead to a richer, more thought-provoking, and emotionally resonant storytelling experience. It challenges both characters and readers to grapple with the hero's absence and consider the enduring impact of their actions. When executed thoughtfully, this decision can elevate your story to new heights, making it a memorable and impactful journey for your audience.

The Chosen One:
The Eulogy:
Now, jot down your character's last will and testament. Would they want to be buried or cremated, and where do they wish their remains to go? What would their tombstone read? Who would get their stuff? Who would be omitted from receiving anything and why are they omitted? How do the people who were omitted react to being omitted? Would the people included be satisfied with what they receive? Would they be jealous of what other people receive? What conflicts arise as a direct consequence of the way the will is written?

The Written Will:
Lastly, consider options short of literal death: prison, coma, exile, alien stasis. Anything that takes your protagonist out of action, albeit temporarily, can work. What would be your first choice here? Why would it be their first choice? Once you’ve figured out the answer to this question, write a scene showcasing your decision.
