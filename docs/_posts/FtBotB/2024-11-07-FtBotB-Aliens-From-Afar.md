title:  "FtBotB - An Alien Invasion Story"
description: Here, I've created the opening scene of a first contact story that transforms an ordinary night into humanity's first alien encounter through the eyes of teenager Esma and her younger brother Wyr. When they discover a mysterious silver sphere in their backyard - just the first of many raining from the sky - Esma must quickly shift from curious observer to family protector. By focusing on these crucial first fifteen minutes of an alien invasion through a teen's perspective, I explore how quickly ordinary life can transform into extraordinary circumstances, and how responsibility can fall on unexpected shoulders in times of crisis.

### Working Title:
Sphere

### Story Synopsis:
Esma was startled awake by an insistent tapping on her bedroom door late one night. Irritated at being roused from sleep, she threw off her covers and went to see what could only be her younger brother Wyr wanted. He was bouncing with excitement as he begged Esma to follow him to the backyard, claiming he had discovered a government drone that had crashed. Doubting his dramatic tale, but curious nonetheless, Esma reluctantly followed him outside into the cool night air. When they reached the backyard, Esma's eyes widened in shock. There was indeed something there, but it was no government drone. Smoking faintly in a massive crater was a metallic silver sphere, covered in strange glyphs and characters unlike any writing system Esma had seen before. As she slowly approached, a horrible realization dawned on her - this was no manmade aircraft. This was something alien. Wyr babbled excitedly that the sphere had been completely closed when he first discovered it. But now, a panel had opened along its side, exposing a dark interior. Esma felt a shiver run down her spine. All her childhood fantasies about extraterrestrial life were coming true in the most terrifying way. As Esma stared into the inky abyss within the sphere, struggling with indecision, a sudden cascade of millions of the meteor-like objects rained down about a mile up the valley. Her head snapped up, watching their fiery trails illuminate the night sky. It had to be more of these alien spheres. Fear gripped Esma's heart as the evidence became undeniable, this was an invasion. Adrenaline flooded Esma's veins as her instincts screamed at her to protect her family. Shelter, escape, hide, she had to get them all to safety. Meanwhile, Wyr whimpered in fright, clinging to her as the fiery rain continued. Esma steeled herself, putting an arm around him. They had to get back to the house, rouse their parents and siblings, gather emergency supplies and take cover somewhere far away. The fate of her family, now rested on her teenage shoulders. This was no longer just a childhood fantasy - humanity was now at the center of first contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence. As the smoking craters multiplied before her eyes, she knew her world as she knew it, just fifteen-minutes ago, would never be the same again.
