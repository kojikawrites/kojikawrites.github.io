### From the Back of the Book:
### Working Title:
Plummeting

### Story Synopsis:
Eyvǫra Naldi gazes out the airplane window with a sense of foreboding. Below, the once-vibrant city of Atlanta is now shrouded in an ominous gray haze. She shudders as memories flood back—the brilliant flash of light as the asteroid hit, the ensuing firestorm that engulfed entire neighborhoods in an instant. Now, hours after the cataclysmic impact, Eyvǫra and the three hundred and eighty-five other passengers aboard American Air Flight 671 are left circling endlessly above the ruined city.  

With the airport tower eerily silent and fuel tanks dwindling, the panicked passengers debate their fate. Should they attempt a risky emergency landing, unable to communicate with the tower due to the devastation below? Or should they stay airborne until the engines give out, sacrificing themselves in a doomed nosedive? As anxieties reach a fever pitch, Eyvǫra takes charge. She rallies the passengers with an impassioned speech, convincing them to take their chances with a landing.  

Moved by her courage, the passengers steel themselves as the aircraft descends toward a barren field adjacent to the airport tarmac. The landing gear screeches against the ragged earth as the plane touches down. Now safely on the ground but enveloped in the strange haze, Eyvǫra and the shell-shocked passengers disembark to face the nightmare laid before them.  

Atlanta, once a vibrant metropolis, is now smoldering ruins as far as the eye can see. With communications gone and supplies dwindling, the group struggles to survive in the post-apocalyptic wasteland. Eyvǫra emerges as a leader, scavenging food and organizing teams to care for the injured. However, tensions flare as terror and hunger take their toll. Desperation threatens to tear the group apart.  

Eyvǫra knows their only hope is banding together. Can she keep the group unified long enough to withstand this brave new world? Their ultimate fate will test the limits of the human spirit in the face of unthinkable tragedy.
