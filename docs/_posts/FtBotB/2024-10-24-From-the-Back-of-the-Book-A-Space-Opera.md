### From the Back of the Book:

### Working Title:
The Children of the Stars

### Story Synopsis:
For over fifteen-hundred years, the descendants of the original crew on the starship Farrazoz have been hopelessly lost in space, searching for a way back to a home they’ve never known. Their ancestors set out centuries ago, on a mission to find a new planet for humanity to colonize, after conditions on Earth had grown inhospitable. However, for some reason, lost to the annals of time, that primary mission failed when an unexplained disaster struck - some kind of catastrophic navigational failure that sent The Farrazoz hurtling off course, far from any known star systems. Ever since that event, each new generation has taken up the mantle of trying to get back to Earth. However, it's a seemingly impossible task, as over time, the ship's records and star charts have become fragmented and corrupted, and there are strange malfunctions that continuously pull them further astray, leading some to wonder if the ship itself is haunted by the crews of the past. This story follows Arvie Heller, the latest navigator, tasked with solving the riddle of The Farrazoz's current path. She pours over the damaged astrogation data and the numerous ancestral captain's logs, searching for any clues that might help her. However, each promising lead seems to take them into one empty, uninhabitable star system after another. Arvie struggles with the crushing responsibility on her shoulders. If she fails, they will remain adrift and The Farrazoz will potentially become this generation's tomb. Pressure mounts when a series of unexplained power surges causes critical systems to start failing, pushing the ship towards catastrophe and Arvie suspects that someone or something is sabotaging them purposefully. As systems continue to collapse, tensions rise between the various factions that have developed amongst the divided crew. The shipboard society is breaking down after centuries of isolation and confinement. Mutiny seems imminent. Just when all seems lost and Arvie is fixing to collapse under all of the mounting pressure, The Farrazoz receives a strange signal leading them to an undiscovered wormhole. Instantly intrigued, Arvie sees it as The Farrazoz’s last desperate chance. Although, the crew is rattled by rumors that it could be a trap by an unidentified alien force. Feeling she has no other options available to her, Arvie gives the order to enter the wormhole and what The Farrazoz finds on the other side changes absolutely everything, as The Farrazoz crew finally uncovers the truth about their lost voyage across the stars.
