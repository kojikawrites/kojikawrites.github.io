## Story Synopsis:
Henley Rodgers thought he had it all - a beautiful wife, one wonderful daughter, and a successful career as an architect. However, when his wife Geanee suddenly falls ill and passes away, Henley's world comes crashing down. He now struggles to balance grieving and working, with raising his five-year-old daughter Kirby, alone. Just getting her to daycare each morning feels like an impossible task. It's on these daily preschool drop-offs that Henley first crosses paths with Sparrel Marietti, another single parent. Sparrel too, is rebuilding a life for her young son Kainanin, after narrowly escaping an abusive marriage. Her ex-husband Jaor nearly killed her before she finally worked up the courage to take their son and finally flee. Now, Sparrel constantly looks over her shoulder, worried Jaor will find them. She tries to focus on creating normalcy for Kainanin, but the trauma of abuse hangs over both of them. Sparrel had given up on love or finding happiness again. Yet, every morning when Henley greets her with his trademark “We've got to stop meeting like this,” his kindness and playful smile stirs something inside Sparrel. As they chat while they get their kids through the door, she remembers what it feels like to simply enjoy another person's company. Henley too finds himself looking forward to these brief moments with Sparrel. In the midst of grief, fear and newfound single parenthood, their morning encounters become a bright spot in their days. Henley senses a kindred spirit in Sparrel, as they both rebuild lives shattered by fear and loss. Over time, a deeper affection grows. Henley wonders if he's ready to move on from his wife's death and open his heart again. Sparrel questions if she can overcome the scars of abuse to trust another man to be near her and Kainanin. The stakes are raised when Jaor unexpectedly shows up, consumed with possessive rage over his ex-wife finding happiness with someone new. As Sparrel's worst fears come to pass, Henley must decide if he's willing to risk it all for a second shot at love. In order to build a new life, they'll both have to let go of the ghosts of the past, and it starts with dealing with Jaor once and for all. With high emotional stakes, their tentative new connection is put to the ultimate test. However, through their growing love, each begins to heal and glimpse the light of a hopeful future again. Their story explores the complexities of moving on after trauma, while touchingly portraying the redemptive power of human connection.
