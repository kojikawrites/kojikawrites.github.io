title:  "FtBotB - A Love Story"
description: I've crafted a love story with an immortal twist, following MacColl Albers, a man who's lived through millennia of human history only to find real purpose when he meets art historian Isolde Ciernik. When she mysteriously disappears, the story transforms into a tense investigation that forces Mac to confront both his painful past and dangerous present. Through Mac's desperate search for Isolde, I explore themes of eternal love, the burden of immortality, and how finding the right person can give even an endless life new meaning. The story challenges whether love can truly conquer time and whether someone who's lost everything can find the courage to risk their heart again.

### Working Title:
Whispers of Forever

### Story Synopsis:
MacColl Albers has lived for Millenniums, cursed with immortality that has brought him more pain than joy. He has fought in humanity's bloodiest wars, witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, loved and lost more times than he can count. However, nothing prepared him for Isolde Ciernik. When Mac meets Isolde, a vivacious art historian, he feels truly alive for the first time in decades. Her joyful spirit reawakens parts of him he thought were long dead. For once, Mac starts making plans for the future instead of just drifting aimlessly through time. He dares to hope that he has finally found someone to spend an eternity with. Just when Mac believes he has found happiness, Isolde goes missing. Consumed with worry, Mac joins the search party combing the city for her. The disappearance dredges up traumatic memories of loved ones lost over the centuries. As each hour passes with no sign of Isolde, Mac's worst fears take hold - that he is doomed to lose everyone close to him. Determined not to let history repeat itself, Mac uses his extensive knowledge and connections to investigate Isolde's disappearance. He uncovers clues suggesting she may have been targeted because of a rare medieval manuscript she recently authenticated. Mac is forced to confront enemies from his past and descend into a dangerous criminal underworld. The stakes have never been higher for Mac. This time he is fighting not just for a loved one's life but also for the chance at a different type of future. As his immortality weighs heavily, Mac questions whether he can protect Isolde when he couldn't save so many others. Will his love withstand the test of time or will Mac's curse of immortality ultimately cost him everything? The only thing he is sure of is, he no longer wishes to die.
