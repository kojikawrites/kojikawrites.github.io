### From the Back of the Book:

### Working Title:
Fragments - When Love and Lies Combine

### Story Synopsis:
Evangelija Markov had a gift, one she’s used for personal gain since she was a young girl. With just a bat of her eyelashes and a dulcet tone to her voice, she could convince anyone to do her bidding. Over the years, she manipulated countless wealthy men into giving her money, jewels, cars - anything she desired, really. To the outside world, she was seen as a beautiful, but manipulative gold digger. However, Evangelija didn't see it that way. To her, it was just good business. When she met Diomid Petrescu, a charming real estate mogul, she thought she had finally found true love. Diomid was intensely passionate and seemed to adore Evangelija. Swept up in romance, she let her guard down and vowed to leave her old ways behind. A few months into their whirlwind relationship, Diomid suggested Evangelija transfer all her assets to a shared account. Eager to start their new life together, she immediately agreed and contacted her financial advisor to begin the process. However, when the advisor questioned inconsistencies in Diomid's records, a horrifying realization dawned on Evangelija - Diomid possessed the same powers of persuasion that she did. He had played her using her own tricks against her. Fury and heartbreak warred within Evangelija at Diomid's betrayal. She realized then that she had never turned her powers off as she claimed. Diomid had simply overpowered her gift with his own. But no more. She would not be manipulated and discarded so easily. Evangelija steeled herself, ready to fight fire with fire. She would show Diomid just how dangerous she could be when provoked. The game was on, and this time she would be the victor. She would take everything back from him and more. Evangelija vowed Diomid would regret the day he dared to cross her. Once she was through with him, he would be left with nothing but heartbreak, just as she had been.
