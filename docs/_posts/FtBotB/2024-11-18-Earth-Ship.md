## From the Back of the Book:
## Working Title:
Earth Ship

## Story Synopsis:
The year is 2954. After decades of environmental decline, humanity has achieved the unthinkable—technology capable of artificially maintaining Earth's atmosphere and temperature no matter where in the universe the planet is located. No longer dependent on the Sun’s warmth and light, the Earth itself has been transformed into a colossal spaceship, ready to voyage into the cosmic unknown.  

Brilliant scientist Dr. Avigayil Gray has been appointed Captain of the Earth Ship. Though ambitious and headstrong, Avigayil’s controversial ideas about planetary migration have won her few allies among the mission’s scientists and engineers. Her most vocal critic is renowned astrophysicist Dr. Vikram Milovanović, who believes that tampering with Earth’s natural relationship with the Sun is, at best, reckless narcissism and, at worst, dangerous hubris. As the launch date nears, Avigayil and Vikram’s professional antagonism erupts into a passionate argument, leading them to sever their working relationship.  

The launch proceeds flawlessly, and months later, the Earth Ship clears the boundaries of the Milky Way. For sixteen months, everything progresses smoothly. However, on the seventeenth month of the journey, catastrophe strikes. A catastrophic systems failure causes a radiation leak, throwing the planet into utter chaos as the Earth Ship is hurtled off-course into uncharted space. Cut off from the Sun and lost in the void, the planet’s artificial life-support systems begin to steadily fail.  

As food and water supplies dwindle, Avigayil and Vikram are forced to put aside their differences to find a solution. Desperate, they initiate an experimental procedure, channeling the Earth’s internal heat to repower the engines and restore critical support systems. The maneuver is successful, but it comes with an unforeseen side effect: the planet’s molten core becomes dangerously unstable. Worldwide volcanic eruptions and tectonic shifts become imminent, plunging society into chaos.  

With no time to return Earth to its original orbit, Avigayil and Vikram make a desperate decision—to find a habitable planet to settle before the end comes for them all. As annihilation looms, Avigayil begins to realize that her unwavering faith in science and ambition alone is not enough. For humanity to survive, she must balance her drive with Vikram’s cautious wisdom and the insights of others.  

In this crucible among the stars, Avigayil and Vikram discover that only by working together can they guide the Earth Ship to safety and forge a hopeful future for humankind. Their journey becomes not only a fight for survival but also a testament to the power of collaboration, humility, and the enduring resilience of the human spirit.
