## From the Back of the Book:
## Working Title:
When the Bones Speak (Book Two of The Klaite Moran Chronicles)

## Story Synopsis:
Three years after Reynel Joris’ execution, Klaite Moran has struggled to recover from her trauma and regain her moral compass. She is more cautious about crossing ethical lines for a story. However, her journalist instincts of old kick in when some unsuspecting contractors uncover a decades-old mass grave on Enzoc Baure’s Farm. As Klaite investigates further, she discovers connections between the farm, its reclusive owners, and her late interview subject Reynel. She learns the Baure allowed Reynel to dispose of some his victims' bodies on their land, in exchange for a seat in the political sphere, money and other small favors, thus raising his previous body count from that of fifty, to now, well over one-hundred. Though Reynel is gone, Klaite pieces together clues he left behind about the skeletons buried on the farm. Things become even murkier when DNA evidence suggests some victims may have been killed by the Jedd Baure himself, as early as the 1950s. With a combination of intrigue and repulsion, Klaite digs deeper into the Baure's murky past, while also reflecting on her complicated relationship with Reynel. She wonders why Reynel kept this secret when he’d swore that he had told her everything. If he’d told her, she could have prevented additional deaths by exposing the truth about the Baure's complicity, while Reynel was still alive. Her reporting reveals the Baures were involved in political criminal activity, overseas black market dealings with known terrorist networks, human trafficking and murders, beyond those connected to Reynel. As she closes in on the full scope of the decades-long killing spree, the Baures begin targeting Klaite, in order to silence her permanently. She debates warning them off with some of Reynel's intimidation tactics, but knows she must find a moral way to bring them to justice and give these new victims' families closure. Klaite decides exposing the truth publicly is the only way, even if it puts her life at risk again. With Reynel gone, Klaite realizes the mantle has fallen to her to unravel the Baure's crimes, as thoroughly as she did his. While still filled with regret over her past ethical transgressions, Klaite finds new purpose and redemption in making sure the full truth about the Baure's murderous secrets is finally revealed.
