description: I've crafted a science fiction narrative about Ezwatti Levar, a postal worker whose loyalty to Earth compromises the neutrality of the Interstellar Postal Service during an interstellar war. Through Ezwatti's story, I explore themes of duty versus ethics, examining how one person's choices can have far-reaching consequences.

## From the Back of the Book:
## Working Title:
The Postman  
## Story Synopsis:
Ezwatti Levar has dedicated his life to being a postman for the Interstellar Postal Service, an organization founded to facilitate communication and trade between the many inhabited planets across the galaxy. Though interstellar travel is commonplace in this era, reliably delivering messages and goods across astronomical distances remains a monumental challenge, one that the neutral Interstellar Postal Service seeks to overcome. Ezwatti finds purpose and takes pride in being part of this vital network that connects the disparate planetary colonies, providing a lifeline for countless worlds. However, everything changes when mounting political tensions between Earth and several alien civilizations erupt into all-out war. As battles rage across space and essential supply lines are disrupted, Ezwatti watches in dismay as the ISPS comes under threat. If the combatants lose faith in the postal service's neutrality, its couriers could become targets, and the entire system risks collapsing. Driven by patriotic loyalty, Ezwatti decides to secretly intercept and divert crucial enemy communications to his government on Earth. He hopes this inside information will help turn the tide of the war in humanity's favor. While already risky, his unsanctioned espionage mission becomes even more dangerous when he's caught by enemy forces. Subjected to brutal interrogation, Ezwatti refuses to crack and reveal his agenda. But his captors eventually uncover enough evidence to realize the bigger implications of his actions - the diplomatic fallout now endangering ISPS neutrality and making couriers spies in the eyes of the enemy. This grave mistake exposes the magnitude of his miscalculation, as he realizes the jeopardy he's brought not only upon himself but also upon the thousands of other couriers who form the backbone of the interstellar postal system. His actions have single handily, inadvertently threatened the very existence of this vital lifeline, turning couriers across the galaxy into targets amid a war where information is just as critical as firepower. Ezwatti is wracked with guilt over this unintentional consequence, knowing he's jeopardized not just his own safety but that of postal workers everywhere. Yet despite the personal stakes, he remains steadfastly committed to his duty and finds a way to escape captivity. Now a fugitive behind enemy lines, he perseveres in delivering his stolen intelligence to Earth, determined to see his mission through to the end. With political tensions continuing to mount, ripple effects from Ezwatti's actions call into question the ISPS's once-sacrosanct neutrality. As governments start seeing postal couriers more as information operatives than neutral parties, their safety can no longer be guaranteed, even as the service's role keeps growing more vital amidst wartime disruption. Ezwatti remains a soldier for Earth's cause, knowing he still has a critical role to play for his people, even on the run with his life constantly at risk. But he also grieves the loss of innocence for his beloved ISPS, and the dream of impartial exchange and communication he always stood for. As the fate of the entire galaxy hangs in the balance, Ezwatti struggles to reconcile his loyalty to country with his devotion to the ideals of the Interstellar Postal Service.
