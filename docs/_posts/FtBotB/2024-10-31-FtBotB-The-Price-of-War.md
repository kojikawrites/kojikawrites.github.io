title:  "FtBotB - A Zombie Tale"
description: I've crafted an alternate history/horror novel that reimagines the Civil War through a supernatural lens, introducing an ancient Aniyvwiyan artifact that transforms the conflict into something far more terrifying. The story follows unlikely allies - a Confederate soldier who discovers the artifact and a Union spy - as they work with an Aniyvwiyan Adawehi to stop an ancient evil from using the war's bloodshed for its own apocalyptic purposes. By blending historical elements with supernatural horror and Native American mythology, I explore how the desperate pursuit of power can unleash forces beyond human control, ultimately leading to consequences that blur the lines between victor and vanquished.

## Story Synopsis:
The story opens in the midst of The American Civil War. A young confederate soldier stumbles upon an ancient Aniyvwiyan artifact deep within a hidden cave system. The artifact possesses mysterious powers that could potentially alter the course of the war. The soldier becomes entranced by the artifact's allure, hearing whispers of promised power and victory. Tempted by its influence, he decides to present the artifact to his commanding officers, believing it could turn the tide of the war in the confederacy's favor. Confederate leaders, desperate for any advantage, begin to delve into the artifact's origins and its potential use. They kidnap a Aniyvwiya Adawehi, who they then force to uncover dark rituals and incantations that can harness its power. However, these new insights and the new power comes at a terrible cost. Sinister experiments and sacrifices are conducted in secret, turning the war into a battle not just of armies, but of ancient Aniyvwiyan magic. Union spies eventually catch wind of the confederacy's newfound power and the existence of the artifact. They report back to their leaders, who are both skeptical and alarmed by the potential threat. A special task force is assembled to investigate and counter the confederate's supernatural advantage. As the war progresses, the use of the artifact's power becomes more apparent. Battlefields are transformed into nightmarish landscapes, with the dead rising, as grotesque and unholy abominations. Soldiers on both sides are forced to confront not only their mortal enemies, but also the dead horrors unleashed by the power of the artifact. The confederate soldier, who initially discovered the artifact begins to question the cost of wielding such power. He witnesses the toll it takes on his fellow soldiers and the land itself. Haunted by the horrors he has unleashed, he starts to doubt the righteousness of their cause. A union soldier, tasked with infiltrating the confederate ranks in order to learn more about the power and the artifact, finds himself forming an unexpected bond with the conflicted confederate soldier. Together, they free the Aniyvwiyan Adawehi, in the hopes of uncovering the true nature of the artifact, the ancient evil it contains and a way to contain it. The Aniyvwiyan Adawehi reveals that the artifact is merely a vessel for a malevolent entity from an ancient Aniyvwiyan legend. This entity has been manipulating both sides, feeding on the chaos and bloodshed of the war. Its ultimate goal is to resurrect an ancient army and claim dominion over the land. The union and confederate soldiers, now united by a common cause, race against time to find a way to seal the artifact’s power and banish the entity back to its realm. They seek the help from other tribes who hold the knowledge of ancient rituals and countermeasures. In a climactic battle, the combined forces of union and confederate soldiers, along with their tribal allies, make a final stand against the entity and its horrendous resurrected army. The fate of the nation hangs in the balance as they fight not only for victory, but for the very soul of America. Though the entity is ultimately defeated, and the artifact sealed away, the cost is high. All three sides have suffered immense losses, and the nation is left scarred by the horrors they’ve both experienced and witnessed. The war ends, with no clear victor. The wounds run deep, and the memory of the supernatural conflict lingers. In the aftermath of the war, the survivors attempt to rebuild their lives and the nation. However, the scars of the supernatural battles remain, and strange occurrences continue to haunt the land. Some fear that the entity's influence is not entirely vanquished, leaving an uneasy peace in its wake. The end of the story explores themes of sacrifice, the power of unity in the face of adversity, and the consequences of wielding power without fully understanding its true nature. It delves into the complexities of war, the blurring of moral lines, and the enduring impact of the choices made during the conflict.
