title:  "FtBotB - A Zombie Tale - The Price of War"
description: I've crafted an alternate history/horror novel that reimagines the Civil War through a supernatural lens, introducing an ancient Aniyvwiyan artifact that transforms the conflict into something far more terrifying. The story follows unlikely allies - a Confederate soldier who discovers the artifact and a Union spy - as they work with an Aniyvwiyan Adawehi to stop an ancient evil from using the war's bloodshed for its own apocalyptic purposes. By blending historical elements with supernatural horror and Native American mythology, I explore how the desperate pursuit of power can unleash forces beyond human control, ultimately leading to consequences that blur the lines between victor and vanquished.

## From the Back of the Book:
## Working Title:
The Price of War
&nbsp;
## Story Synopsis:
The story begins amidst the chaos of the American Civil War. Deep within a hidden cave system, a young Confederate soldier stumbles upon an ancient Aniyvwiyan artifact. Intricately carved and humming with a strange, otherworldly energy, the artifact seems alive. Whispers echo in the soldier's mind, promising power and victory if he wields it. Entranced by its allure, he decides to present the artifact to his commanding officers, convinced it could turn the tide of the war in the Confederacy's favor.  

The artifact immediately garners attention from Confederate leaders, desperate for any advantage. Intrigued yet wary of its potential, they forcefully abduct an Aniyvwiya Adawehi—a spiritual leader—demanding they unlock the artifact’s secrets. Under duress, the Adawehi reveals fragments of ancient rituals and incantations tied to the artifact’s power. The Confederate leadership seizes upon this knowledge, initiating dark experiments and sacrifices to harness its energy. What begins as a tactical pursuit of victory soon spirals into something far darker, as the artifact’s power begins to warp the natural world. The Civil War becomes not only a clash of armies but a battle against an ancient and malevolent magic.  

Union spies catch wind of the Confederacy’s terrifying new weapon, though initial reports are met with skepticism. As grotesque and unholy abominations begin to appear on the battlefield, the Union can no longer ignore the growing threat. A special task force is assembled to investigate the artifact and counter the Confederacy's supernatural advantage. Among their ranks is a soldier ordered to infiltrate the Confederate lines, learning all he can about the artifact’s origin and use.  

The artifact’s power takes a devastating toll, transforming battlefields into nightmarish scenes of chaos and horror. The dead rise as monstrous abominations, and soldiers are forced to fight both their mortal enemies and these terrifying creations. Even Confederate soldiers, initially emboldened by their newfound advantage, grow uneasy. The young soldier who first discovered the artifact begins to question the righteousness of his cause as he witnesses the destruction wrought by the power he unleashed. His unease deepens when he forms an unexpected bond with the Union infiltrator, who shares his fears about the artifact’s devastating consequences.  

Together, the two soldiers devise a plan to free the Aniyvwiyan Adawehi, hoping they can uncover the artifact’s true nature and a way to stop its destructive influence. The Adawehi reveals a chilling truth: the artifact is not merely a tool but a vessel for an ancient malevolent entity, long feared in Aniyvwiyan legend. This entity has been feeding on the bloodshed and chaos of the war, manipulating both sides to grow stronger. Its ultimate goal is to resurrect its ancient army and claim dominion over the land.  

United by a common cause, the Confederate soldier, the Union infiltrator, and the freed Adawehi join forces. They seek the aid of other tribes who possess knowledge of ancient countermeasures and rituals capable of sealing the entity away. As the conflict reaches its climax, the combined forces of Union and Confederate soldiers, along with their tribal allies, prepare for a final battle against the entity and its unholy army.  

In a desperate, climactic confrontation, the unlikely alliance faces overwhelming odds. Soldiers from both sides fight alongside the Aniyvwiyan warriors, their differences cast aside in the face of a greater threat. Together, they manage to seal the artifact and banish the entity back to its realm, but the cost is staggering. The battlefield is littered with the fallen, and the survivors are forever changed by what they have witnessed.  

The war draws to an uneasy close, with no clear victor. The horrors of the supernatural conflict leave deep scars on all sides. The artifact is buried, its power contained but not destroyed, and whispers persist that the entity’s influence may not be entirely vanquished. Survivors attempt to rebuild their lives and the fractured nation, but strange occurrences and dark omens suggest that the past cannot be easily forgotten.  

The story’s conclusion explores themes of sacrifice, the consequences of wielding power without understanding its true nature, and the fragile power of unity in the face of overwhelming adversity. It delves into the complexities of war, the blurring of moral lines, and the enduring impact of choices made in desperation. While the entity is defeated, the story leaves an unsettling question lingering: can such darkness ever truly be contained, or will humanity’s thirst for power once again awaken it?
