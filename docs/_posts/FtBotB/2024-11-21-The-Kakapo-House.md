## From the Back of the Book:
## Working Title:
The Kakapo House (Book Three of The Klaite Moran Chronicles)

## Story Synopsis:
After the trauma surrounding Reynel and the Baure case, Klaite desperately needs a retreat to process everything. With her boss Estefany and therapist Lelleann's blessing, she takes a month sabbatical in Massachusetts to recover. Trying to make connections in the quaint town, Klaite meets a man named Jehan Bowen at a coffee shop. Jehan charms her with his talk of bird conservation and invites her to tour his aviary house. Letting her guard down, Klaite eagerly agrees, not realizing Jehan has sinister motives. Entering Jehan's home, Klaite is caught off guard when he violently attacks her with a crowbar. As her cheekbone shatters, she realizes this man is somehow connected to Reynel. Severely injured and terrified, Klaite finds herself imprisoned by Jehan, Reynel's vengeful son. He blames her for his father’s execution and tarnished reputation due to the Baure’s and delights as he confesses his plan to torture her as payback, before finally killing her. As days of brutal captivity pass, Klaite realizes Jehan has definitely inherited his father's psychopathic tendencies. Desperate to survive, Klaite uses her interviewing skills to manipulate Jehan and buy herself more time. She plays on his emotional vulnerability, seething rage and intense need to know more about his father, to slowly gain his trust. Klaite knows the only way out is to keep her wits and try to get help. With Jehan unstable, she walks a dangerous line placating him, while secretly contacting Estefany and Lelleann with her hidden iWatch. Back in Los Angeles, Estefany and Lelleann work tirelessly with the FBI, investigating her kidnapping. Twenty-six days later, the FBI finally locates Jehan's house of horrors and Klaite escapes by the skin of her teeth when FBI raids the property, saving her from a horrific fate. Beaten but not broken, Klaite slowly recovers from her ordeal. Having faced Reynel's depraved legacy yet again, she emerges wiser and even more committed to seeking justice, even in the darkest places. Klaite accepts she cannot run from her past - only by confronting the monsters can she reclaim her power and purpose.
