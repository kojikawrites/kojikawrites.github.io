I am overall in a good mood today.

My pain levels are a bit high, but I am very happy that I did not require a nap today. I've gotten some transfers and writing done. I was able to play with my kids too. So, I would consider this a sucessful day.

I haven't eaten very much today. It's just so hard to eat, these days. I didn't have the tube feed on today, and I think that, that was a mistake.

Here's to tomorrow being as good as today or better. Oh, and FUCK CANCER...
