### Applied Phlebotinum:
Phlebotinum is the versatile substance that may be rubbed on anything to cause an effect needed by a plot.

### Examples include but are not limited to:
Nanotechnology, magic crystal emanations, pixie dust, and Green Rocks. In essence, it is plot fuel. Without it, the story would grind to an abrupt halt. It's the science that powers the FTL drive on the starship so the characters can get somewhere, it's the magic that hatches the Egg MacGuffin so the protagonist can save an endangered species, it's the strange things unknown to science or magic that do basically anything except those limits and dangers required by the plot. The reader does not know how Phlebotinum would work and the creators hope nobody cares. In essence, it's a plot device that abstracts away the problem of hard science.

### Best Practice:
Consistency is key. While Phlebotinum doesn't need to be scientifically explained, it should follow consistent rules within your story. For Aetheric Crystals:

* Establish clear limitations (e.g., they become unstable if overused)
* Define specific applications and stick to them
* Create plot-relevant drawbacks or risks

By maintaining consistency, you keep the story engaging without frustrating readers with arbitrary changes to how the Phlebotinum works.
