I apologize, I won't be bringing you a course or book review today. I have found a four and a half hour "writing better scenes" course though, that I will hopefully be reviewing tomorrow (I'll try to listen to a good portion of it tonight and then the last bit tomorrow morning). Please bare with me as I work out these scheduling issues. I'll have something for you tomorrow, I hope.
