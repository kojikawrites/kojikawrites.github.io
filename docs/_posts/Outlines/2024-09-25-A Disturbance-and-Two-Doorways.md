title:  "A Disturbance and Two Doorways - An Outline"
description: This is my take on the three-act structure, focusing on two crucial doorways that transform the protagonist's journey. I break down how these transition points work with a story's disturbance and climax, creating a clear path through your narrative. While it works beautifully with adventure and sci-fi, I've found this framework adapts well to any genre where characters face life-changing choices, from emotional journeys to romance.

## A Disturbance and Two Doorways: 
This is a variation of the three-act structure, and is often weaved into other frameworks. The emphasis is on conflict, since nothing happens without conflict.

### There are usually three conflict points:
The Disturbance: This is an event that disrupts the protagonist’s normal world and forces them to take action.

### Doorway One:
The protagonist must make a choice or take action in response to the disturbance, which leads them into a new world or situation. Going back is no longer an option.

### Doorway Two:
The protagonist faces another choice or challenge, which leads to the climax of the story.

It is often combined with some kind of five-point structure that includes a midpoint between the two doors and a climax at the end.

### The Disturbance: 
This is an event that disrupts the protagonist’s normal world and forces them to take action.

### Doorway One: 
The protagonist must make a choice or take action in response to the disturbance, which leads them into a new world or situation. Going back is no longer an option.

### The Midpoint: 
This is a turning point in the story where the protagonist starts responding more proactively, instead of reactively, to the challenges.

### Doorway Two: 
This challenge usually arises as a result of the midpoint shift.

### Climax: 
The protagonist acts on the challenge in doorway two.

This structure can work with any genre, but is particularly good in the adventure, science fiction, and thriller genres where the protagonist goes on some type of quest. It also works in emotional journeys and the search for love.
