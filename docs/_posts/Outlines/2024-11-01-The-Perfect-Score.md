title:  "The Perfect Score - A Heist Outline"
description: I've crafted a detailed heist-to-redemption story outline that follows a protagonist's transformation from a recently released thief to an unlikely hero. Through 39 major story beats, I trace their journey from planning a dangerous heist out of desperation to eventually leading a network of vigilantes fighting corporate corruption. The outline blends classic heist elements - team assembly, planning, unexpected complications - with deeper themes of redemption, moral choices, and justice. Each beat builds naturally from action to consequence, culminating in the protagonist finding a new purpose as a modern-day Robin Hood.
