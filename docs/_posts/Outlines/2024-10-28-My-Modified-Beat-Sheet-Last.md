title:  "My Modified Beat Sheet - Finale"
description: I created this comprehensive beat sheet back in 2009 because I was frustrated with existing story outlines that weren't producing polished, finished stories. The outline breaks down into 174 individual beats across four acts, with each major beat followed by trials and mini-quests that test the protagonist. While it might seem excessive, this detailed structure helps ensure every story element gets proper attention, from character development to plot progression. The trials and mini-quests can be classified as major or minor, with internal, antagonistic, or external focuses, providing a flexible framework for any narrative.

# My Modified Beat Sheet:
Okay, before I put anything down, I want to remind you about trials and mini-quests.

## First Note:
The Trials can be major or minor and have three different, for lack of a better term, identifiers. Too, they show up right after each major beat of the outline. This is one of the many tests the protagonist will undertake throughout the story. He/She will be subjected to a painful, or at least an unpleasant, usually dangerous experience. The test could be one of life or death. This is all about risk, motivation, conflict and resolution.

## Second Note:
The Mini-Quests are similar to quests and sub-quests in that they can be groups of interrelated tasks that can be completed for rewards such as new items, new skills, and new experiences. Ideally, this section should contain at least one-hundred pages or more and it should contain at least twenty-seven-thousand-five-hundred words or more. A mini-quest is a small diversion on the character’s path. If the ultimate goal is to save the princess, then a mini-quest may be to find the magic phone book to look up her address, or to return to your castle because you can’t remember whether or not you closed the draw-bridge. Add a few mini-quests to slow the pace and to develop character and you’ll have earned yourself five-hundred to a thousand words each.

Each trials and mini-quests will be considered one of the following:
- Minor (Random) Internal
- Minor (Random) Antagonistic
- Minor (Random) External
- Minor (Consequential) Internal
- Minor (Consequential) Antagonistic
- Minor (Consequential) External
- Minor (Inconsequential) Internal
- Minor (Inconsequential) Antagonistic
- Minor (Inconsequential) External
- Major (Random) Internal
- Major (Random) Antagonistic
- Major (Random) External
- Major (Consequential) Internal
- Major (Consequential) Antagonistic
- Major (Consequential) External
- Major (Inconsequential) Internal
- Major (Inconsequential) Antagonistic
- Major (Inconsequential) External

Now with no further ado, here's the last part of my modified beat sheet.

## (major beat) The Resolution:
A resolution is a written suggestion for the solution of a problem. It delegates draft resolutions to present written ideas and actions to help overcome world issues and they’re written after the discussion of an issue to present options for action. The protagonist summons the courage and growth to come up with a solution, overcome inner obstacles and conquer the antagonistic force; all new information must have been referenced, foreshadowed or already in play (otherwise, deus ex machina). Ideally this section should contain at least four-hundred pages or more and contain at least one-hundred and ten-thousand words or more.
&nbsp;
## A Trial (see above)
&nbsp;
## A Mini-Quest (see above)
&nbsp;
## (major beat) The Fourth Allied Attack:
This is when a trusted ally confronts the protagonist about their increasing desperation and immorality, and thoroughly questions their behavior. Ideally, this section should contain at least thirty-six pages or more and at least ten-thousand and ten pages or more.
&nbsp;
## A Trial (see above)
&nbsp;
## A Mini-Quest (see above)
&nbsp;
## (major beat) The Climax:
Act III is generally the shortest act and it begins with the climax of the novel. It is most always a battle of some kind and the protagonist always wins and after the win, the story wraps up fairly quickly.
&nbsp;
## A Trial (see above)
&nbsp;
## A Mini-Quest (see above)
&nbsp;
## (major beat) Another Juxtaposition:
An act or instance of placing two elements close together or side by side. This is often done in order to compare/contrast the two, to show similarities or differences, etc. Various forms of juxtaposition occur in literature, where two images that are otherwise not commonly brought together appear side by side or structurally close together, thereby forcing the reader to stop and reconsider the meaning of the text through the contrasting images, ideas, motifs, etc. More broadly, an author can juxtapose contrasting types of characters, such as a protagonist and an antagonist working together to achieve a common objective from very different motivation.
&nbsp;
## A Trial (see above)
&nbsp;
## A Mini-Quest (see above)
&nbsp;
## (major beat) The Last of the Fun and Games:
“The promise of the premise”/the heart of the story/all about having fun. The entertaining aspects of the story’s premise are explored–highlighting the main character’s unlikeliness for this “upside down world”–which is fun to watch, but NOT fun for the main character, who is essentially in HELL until the end of the story. It's where we aren't as concerned with the forward progress of the story—the stakes won't be raised until the midpoint—as we are concerned with having fun. We take a break from the stakes of the story and see what the idle a is about; we see the promise of the premise and need not see anything else.
&nbsp;
## A Trial (see above)
&nbsp;
## A Mini-Quest (see above)
&nbsp;
## (major beat) The Finale:
Just as there are countless inspiring and effective ways to tell a story, there too are countless inspiring and effective ways to end it.
&nbsp;
## A Trial (see above)
&nbsp;
## A Mini-Quest (see above)
&nbsp;
## (major beat) The Final Image:
Opposite of opening image; show how much change has occurred. The final image of the film wraps up the story by reinforcing the theme, or lesson learned during the B Story.
&nbsp;
## A Trial (see above)
&nbsp;
## A Mini-Quest (see above)
&nbsp;
## (major beat) The Denouement:
This is to illustrate the new life the protagonist has acquired on his/her journey. This is the end of the book. Fin.
&nbsp;
## A Trial (see above):
This is a sneak peek of a new adventure.
&nbsp;
## A Mini-Quest (see above)
This is a sneak peek of a new adventure.

This is a long outline, would you prefer me putting all four parts into one post or do you like that I've broken it up into smaller sections? Drop me a comment below.
