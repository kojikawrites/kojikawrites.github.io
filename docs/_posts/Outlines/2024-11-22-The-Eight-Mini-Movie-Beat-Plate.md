title:  "The Eight Mini Movie Beat Plate"
description: I explain how my story template divides narratives into eight mini-movies, each representing 12.5% of the total story. Each mini-movie should start with a clear character goal and end with a disaster that propels the story forward, creating a consistent roller-coaster effect for readers. While the template can accommodate multiple character arcs, it's often more practical to focus on one character's complete journey. This structure helps maintain narrative momentum by ensuring regular dramatic beats and escalating stakes.

In the image of these templates, each mini-movie is 12.5% of the story.  

The templates (as displayed here) should also remind you that the story is about the protagonist (thus the most beats) and less about the other characters (with fewer beats.)  

While the structural elements (colored boxes) are locked in place, the white boxes can be typed in with any style or color of text, and the boxes can be changed in size or moved easily.  

The templates above are laid out for four characters, where each of the character's main beats journey vertically from top to bottom. But this is probably not as practical as using the entire beat plate for one character's entire main plot. Thus you'd have much larger boxes and probably only one column. (see image below).  

One of the great aids this template suggests is to start each mini-movie with the character's goal for that 12.5% or 12.5 pages, and end each with a disaster where the mini- goal is NOT achieved, and which spurns the character on to the next chapter in the story. Only the end of mini-movie 8 ends with success. This also provides the dynamic and REGULAR roller coaster effect you want for your audience (no dull or slow spots, if the disaster escalate and truly endanger your protagonist's achievement of the goal.)  

I know everything concerning the story diamond is really daunting, if you have any questions please leave me a comment down below.
