When I told my husband that I wanted to create a website/blog, he was very supportive and was more than ready and willing to teach me how to do it and how to maintain it on my own, and while I don't have everything involved committed to memory at the time that this post goes live, I do know that if I have any questions, he's going to do his best to answer them and show me how to do what I'm asking for.

So, why am I talking about this? Well, it's a bit of a segway into what I want to discuss, and that is helping out other new authors, and by help, I mean helping new authors hold on to their money.

When I thought about creating this blog, I thought that I want to be of help to writers like me. So, with that being said, I am going to review writing systems and writing courses, so that the new writers out there can save their money for publishing that magnum opus that will make them a New York bestseller.
