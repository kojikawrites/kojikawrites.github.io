The short answer is no and the long answer is still too, no. As much as a lot of us feel as though AI poses an existential threat to our work, the real competition we currently face is, dare I say it, each other. There are just way too many authors currently writing and publishing right now. All of us, competing for the few crumbs of prestige, and glimmers of significance, for AI to be the main concern here.

The question we truly need to be asking here is:

How can we make our individual writing more valuable when the supply currently exceeds demand?

Right now, most independent authors are busy working one, two, sometimes even three day jobs in order to keep the lights on, while only dreaming of the time when they’ll have the ability to write full-time.

For me personally, right now anyway, I could spend most of my time focusing on unique perspectives, writing in underserved niches, or developing a strong author brand, but as of now, I see a better income stream for my family and I where the aspiring writer is my customer, rather than readers.

It makes me sad, that for now anyway, my stories will remain in an unpublished document. The sad reality is that I see no less than fifty to one-hundred ads on my socials, on a daily basis, containing a struggling author just like myself attempting to attract readers. 

On the flip side of that coin however, there seems to be an infinite supply of would be writers who’ll pay for digital content, programs, courses and workshops to help them publish their books.

In the meantime, I am unworried about AI and I remain hopeful that one day, this website will allow me to do both sell my novels and help other authors on their writing journey.

What do you see as your major hurdle or competition? I’d love to hear about your personal experiences, thoughts, or strategies for navigating the challenges of the current writing and publishing landscape.
