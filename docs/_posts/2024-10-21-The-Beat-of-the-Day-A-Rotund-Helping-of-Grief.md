I want to talk about grief today. So, both the beat of the day and the outline is going to circle around grief.

Something happens that causes immense grief for the protagonist and his group. This could involve the disillusionment of a relationship, someone physically leaving their group, a negative change of physical, mental, emotional or sexual health, losing something vital to their journey, someone dying, having to leave someplace where they’ve found safety, losing trust in someone, imprisonment, or a loss of faith. This folder can be placed multiple times in the same section or multiple sections, depending on the need too.
