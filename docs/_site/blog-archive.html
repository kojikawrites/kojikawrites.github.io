    <span><strong>The Beat of the Day - Applied Phlebotium</strong></span>
    <p>I explore the concept of Phlebotinum - those versatile plot devices like nanotechnology or magic crystals that help move stories forward without getting bogged down in hard science explanations. While these elements don't need rigorous scientific justification, I emphasize the importance of establishing consistent rules and limitations within your story world to maintain reader engagement. Whether it's Aetheric Crystals or Green Rocks, these tools can serve as effective plot fuel when used thoughtfully and consistently.<br />

    <span><strong>FtBotB - The Postman</strong></span>
    <p>I've crafted a science fiction narrative about Ezwatti Levar, a postal worker whose loyalty to Earth compromises the neutrality of the Interstellar Postal Service during an interstellar war. Through Ezwatti's story, I explore themes of duty versus ethics, examining how one person's choices can have far-reaching consequences. His decision to spy for Earth while maintaining his postal duties raises questions about neutrality in wartime and the true cost of patriotism, ultimately threatening the vital communication network that connects humanity's colonies across the galaxy.<br />

    <span><strong>FtBotB - Earth Ship</strong></span>
    <p>I've developed a sci-fi narrative about Earth's transformation into an interstellar vessel under the leadership of Dr. Avigayil Gray and her rival Dr. Vikram Milovanović. Through their conflict over humanity's technological ambitions and subsequent forced collaboration when disaster strikes, I explore themes of scientific hubris versus caution. As Earth faces destruction from its own unstable core, these opposing viewpoints must find balance to ensure humanity's survival among the stars.<br />

    <span><strong>The Beat of the Day - You&#39;re a Capricious Raconteur</strong></span>
    <p>I explore how unreliable narrators can add complexity and intrigue to storytelling by deliberately misleading or withholding information from readers. Whether through personal bias, mental instability, deception, or limited understanding, these narrators force readers to question the narrative's credibility and draw their own conclusions. I examine how this technique fundamentally alters a story's tone compared to using objective or omniscient perspectives, creating deeper engagement through uncertainty.<br />

    <span><strong>The Beat of the Day - A Cavalier Risk</strong></span>
    <p>I examine the trope I call "A Cavalier Risk" - that crucial moment when a character's early success breeds dangerous overconfidence. Just before the story's midpoint, protagonists often feel invincible after initial victories, leading them to take reckless actions that set up their downfall. Using metaphors like "poking the bear" and "messing with the bull," I describe how this plot point reveals characters' true nature while setting them up for the harsh lessons waiting at the midpoint. This dance between pride and consequence is essential for character development.<br />

    <span><strong>The Adrenaline Machine - A Chapter Elixir</strong></span>
    <p>This is The Adrenaline Machine, which focuses on creating relentless tension through cycles of progress and setbacks. Starting with an intense opening plunge and moving through nine distinct stages of advancement and regression, this framework keeps readers engaged by alternating between moments of hope and despair. The outline culminates in a pivotal pause that leaves everything hanging in suspense, maximizing dramatic tension.<br />

    <span><strong>A Wagon Train - An Outline</strong></span>
    <p>I've created a detailed outline for a Western pioneer story following a wagon train's journey from the Northeast to California's gold country. Through 33 beats, I track their progression from initial preparations through disasters, diseases, indigenous encounters, interpersonal conflicts, and eventual settlement. The outline balances external challenges like treacherous river crossings and confrontations with internal struggles like budding romances and betrayals, culminating in the pioneers establishing new lives and passing their legacy to future generations. This template provides a framework for exploring both the physical and emotional journeys of westward expansion.<br />

Despite dealing with chronic pain, late starts, and worried moments, I found joy in unexpected places - like some meaningful progress with my work. I'm learning to acknowledge both the ups and downs, celebrating small victories like posting content even when I don't feel like doing it.

    <span><strong>Some Advice</strong></span>
    <p>I reflect on the unique value of being a beginner in your craft. While many rush to move beyond this stage as soon as challenges arise, I emphasize how the early learning phase offers special opportunities for growth and development that become rarer as you advance. I encourage writers to embrace and appreciate their beginner status, as each new level of mastery makes transformative growth spurts increasingly difficult to achieve.<br />

    <span><strong>FtBotB - An Extinction Level Event</strong></span>
    <p>I've developed a post-apocalyptic survival story focused on Eyvǫra Naldi and 385 other passengers stranded in the air above a devastated Atlanta after an asteroid impact. The synopsis follows their harrowing decision to attempt a landing and subsequent struggle to survive in the ruined city. Through Eyvǫra's emergence as a leader, I explore themes of human resilience and group dynamics in the face of catastrophe. The story asks whether unity can prevail when civilization crumbles.<br />

    <span><strong>Internal Conflict - An Exercise:</strong></span>
    <p>This is a tool to help writers identify their characters' core internal conflicts by examining the interplay between emotional wounds, outer goals, and inner needs. By understanding how past trauma shapes current motivations, writers can develop more compelling character arcs. This framework helps uncover the deeper psychological struggles that drive character growth and plot development.<br />

    <span><strong>Character Arc Progression - An Exercise:</strong></span>
    <p>This framework is for understanding how character wounds shape story arcs. By examining the relationship between traumatic past events and current behaviors, we can trace how wounds generate fears, false beliefs, and dysfunctional coping mechanisms. I provide targeted questions to help writers identify their characters' basic human needs, motivations, and conflicts that stem from these formative wounds. This flowchart approach helps create more psychologically complex character arcs.<br />

    <span><strong>A Scene Card - An Exercise</strong></span>
    <p>I break down the key differences between illustrative and non-illustrative scenes in writing. Strong scenes actively challenge characters and show them making decisions in varied environments, revealing growth through their changing responses to similar situations. To help writers create more dynamic scenes, I've developed a checklist of essential elements - from setting and timing to emotional arcs and conflict sources. This framework helps identify whether you're truly showing character development or merely telling readers what to think.<br />

    <p>I've created a comprehensive outline for a mystery/crime story structure, detailing every major beat from the initial "Act of Depravity" through to the final resolution. Each section serves a specific purpose in building tension, developing investigation threads, and maintaining reader engagement. The outline includes multiple red herrings, false objectives, and plot complications to keep both protagonists and readers guessing. I pay particular attention to character development through the investigation process, while emphasizing the importance of consistent clue placement and logical resolution. This framework helps writers craft mysteries that balance procedural elements with emotional depth.<br />

    <span><strong>Let&#39;s Discuss Diverse Representation in Literature</strong></span>
    <p>I address the important topic of diverse representation in literature, particularly focusing on remixes and retellings that incorporate marginalized perspectives. Through my own experience as someone from marginalized communities, I explain why seeing ourselves reflected in literature matters so deeply. While some readers may resist these new interpretations, I emphasize that more inclusive storytelling enriches literature without diminishing existing works. Books that aren't written for you don't take anything away - they simply give others the joy of recognition that many readers have long taken for granted.<br />

    <span><strong>Surviving Loss</strong></span>
    <p>I explore different forms of loss and their impact on character development, from death of loved ones to loss of freedom or innocence. By examining how these experiences connect to basic human needs like self-actualization and belonging, I provide a framework for understanding character motivation and growth through grief. I break down the preparatory steps characters might take to overcome loss, potential sacrifices they'll face, and roadblocks they'll encounter, while emphasizing the high stakes of failing to process grief properly. This helps writers craft more authentic character arcs around themes of loss and recovery.<br />

    <span><strong>FtBotB - A Fantasy Novel</strong></span>
    <p>I've crafted a suspense-filled story synopsis about Havann Norris, a skilled gamer who wakes up trapped in a mysterious cell after a marathon gaming session. By blending elements of gaming culture with real-world peril, I explore how her virtual skills might translate to actual survival scenarios. The enigmatic old man's cryptic warning about "next time" sets up intriguing questions about the nature of her captivity and suggests this might be more than a simple kidnapping. Through Havann's perspective, I frame her predicament as the ultimate escape room challenge.<br />

    <span><strong>FtBotB - Classroom Consequences</strong></span>
    <p>I've developed a story examining institutional failure and systematic abuse through the character of Zivit Suhny, a student pushed to her breaking point after years of trauma at Gregory Hautum High School. Following her sexual assault by a history teacher and subsequent gaslighting by school administration, my narrative explores how continued institutional betrayal and denial can lead to devastating consequences. Through Zivit's story, I confront difficult themes about power dynamics, accountability, and the dire effects of ignoring victims' voices in educational settings.<br />

    <span><strong>Writing Without Vices - An Exercise</strong></span>
    <p>I've created an exercise focused on identifying and breaking troublesome writing habits, drawing from my own experience with overemphasizing physical movement and overusing words like 'glance.' By prompting writers to identify their worst habits, most used words, writing crutches, and reliance on glue words, I provide a framework for more conscious writing choices. Through deliberately writing without these familiar patterns, we can discover whether they're truly necessary or just comfortable fallbacks, ultimately strengthening our storytelling craft.<br />

    <p>I've developed a comprehensive exercise exploring how cataclysmic events can reveal deeper character truths, even for stories dealing with smaller-scale conflicts. Through examining characters' responses to scenarios like asteroid impacts, plagues, or alien invasions, we can uncover vital insights about their values, relationships, and decision-making processes. I provide specific prompts about survival choices, moral dilemmas, and emotional arcs, along with tools like character journals and scene emotion maps to help writers dig deeper into their characters' core nature. By understanding how characters react when everything falls apart, we can better portray their responses to any level of conflict.<br />

    <span><strong>The Impairment Framework</strong></span>
    <p>Injuries add realism and grit. Let’s face it, how many action movies have we watched where the heroes walk into a haze of bullets and come out on the other side completely unscathed? Come on, you are capable of better than that boring schtick. Ultimately, injuries are story catalysts. They inspire change, though that change is almost universally unwelcome and painful on both physical and psychological levels. Moreover, injuries and pain show us what characters are truly made of. Now, there are six distinct phases of the injury plot. Here they are, broken down by individual section.<br />

    <span><strong>FtBotB - An Alien Invasion Story</strong></span>
    <p>Here, I've created the opening scene of a first contact story that transforms an ordinary night into humanity's first alien encounter through the eyes of teenager Esma and her younger brother Wyr. When they discover a mysterious silver sphere in their backyard - just the first of many raining from the sky - Esma must quickly shift from curious observer to family protector. By focusing on these crucial first fifteen minutes of an alien invasion through a teen's perspective, I explore how quickly ordinary life can transform into extraordinary circumstances, and how responsibility can fall on unexpected shoulders in times of crisis.<br />

    <p>I've crafted a love story with an immortal twist, following MacColl Albers, a man who's lived through millennia of human history only to find real purpose when he meets art historian Isolde Ciernik. When she mysteriously disappears, the story transforms into a tense investigation that forces Mac to confront both his painful past and dangerous present. Through Mac's desperate search for Isolde, I explore themes of eternal love, the burden of immortality, and how finding the right person can give even an endless life new meaning. The story challenges whether love can truly conquer time and whether someone who's lost everything can find the courage to risk their heart again.<br />

    <p>I explain the Q-Factor - a powerful storytelling technique where an emotional element, introduced early in the story, returns at the protagonist's darkest moment to help them overcome their fears and challenges. By establishing this element in Act One, subtly referencing it mid-story, and bringing it back at a crucial moment, we can create deeply resonant scenes without heavy-handed explanation. Through a five-step process, I demonstrate how to effectively weave this device into your narrative, making those rock-bottom moments more impactful and meaningful.<br />

Through 39 major story beats, I trace their journey from planning a dangerous heist out of desperation to eventually leading a network of vigilantes fighting corporate corruption. The outline blends classic heist elements - team assembly, planning, unexpected complications - with deeper themes of redemption, moral choices, and justice. Each beat builds naturally from action to consequence, culminating in the protagonist finding a new purpose as a modern-day Robin Hood.<br />

Drawing from various aspects of the craft - dialogue, description, character development, and even profanity usage - I offer guidance on avoiding common pitfalls like the overused "show, don't tell" rule and creating more authentic, engaging narratives.

    <p>I've developed a post-apocalyptic story that pairs an unlikely duo - a social media-obsessed teenager and a grizzled survivalist - in the aftermath of catastrophic solar flares. Through Ayres Jorge and Ozman Shaugh's journey, I explore how different generations and mindsets might adapt to survive in a world stripped of technology. As they face various threats, from looters to warlords, their complementary skills and perspectives help them not only survive but eventually lead others in rebuilding society. The narrative challenges the typical "hunker down and defend" approach of survival stories, suggesting that true hope lies in bringing people together rather than hiding from them.<br />

The story follows unlikely allies - a Confederate soldier who discovers the artifact and a Union spy - as they work with an Aniyvwiyan Adawehi to stop an ancient evil from using the war's bloodshed for its own apocalyptic purposes. By blending historical elements with supernatural horror and Native American mythology, I explore how the desperate pursuit of power can unleash forces beyond human control, ultimately leading to consequences that blur the lines between victor and vanquished.<br />

While it's more than a single story beat but less than a complete outline, this flexible framework can repeat throughout a story, showing how characters cycle through heroic moments, mistakes, paralysis, and deliberate choices to persevere. Each section can be used multiple times as needed, making it a versatile tool for developing character arcs and plot progression.<br />

From Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece to Persephone's journey to the underworld, these classical stories illuminate how planetary energies and archetypal patterns guide us through our own personal quests for meaning and growth.<br />

Importantly, what's strange today may become familiar tomorrow, pushing writers to constantly innovate.<br />

The outline particularly emphasizes the protagonist's moral choices and their consequences, making it especially useful for redemptive character arcs.<br />

    <p>I created this comprehensive beat sheet back in 2009 because I was frustrated with existing story outlines that weren't producing polished, finished stories. The outline breaks down into 174 individual beats across four acts, with each major beat followed by trials and mini-quests that test the protagonist. While it might seem excessive, this detailed structure helps ensure every story element gets proper attention, from character development to plot progression. The trials and mini-quests can be classified as major or minor, with internal, antagonistic, or external focuses, providing a flexible framework for any narrative.<br />

    <p>Drawing from Robert Greene's "The Forty-Eight Laws of Power," I've laid out a comprehensive guide to understanding power dynamics for writers crafting compelling characters. From "Never Outshine the Master" to "Assume Formlessness," these laws offer fascinating insights into how power operates and can be wielded in storytelling. While some principles might seem Machiavellian, they provide valuable tools for developing complex power dynamics in fiction, whether you're writing heroes, villains, or morally ambiguous characters navigating their way through positions of influence.<br />

The story combines elements of mystery, potential sabotage, and the weight of ancestral mission as Arvie tries to guide her people home. Through themes of isolation, responsibility, and the breakdown of society under extreme circumstances, the narrative builds to a revelation that promises to upend everything the crew believes about their journey. I'm curious how this premise resonates with readers, particularly those familiar with the space opera genre.<br />

At around $15 for paperback or $11 for Kindle, this three-star book offers useful insights into managing writing time, overcoming blocks, and mastering the revision process with its "Write what you can imagine" approach.<br />

The story delves into themes of faith, artistic expression, and forbidden love, while examining the costs of following one's heart. As I develop this premise, I'm curious about readers' reactions to this genre-blending approach to Amish romance and whether the story's focus on creative passion alongside romantic love would resonate with potential readers.<br />

I've created an exercise using paper strips to randomly reassign character relationships, along with prompts to help writers explore the implications of these changes. Whether it's visualizing hypothetical dates between characters or examining how family roles might shift, these relationship adjustments can add unexpected depth to your narrative.<br />

While luck often serves as a story catalyst - like meet-cutes or chance discoveries - I emphasize that mid-story fortune must feel authentic rather than contrived. By examining how both protagonists and antagonists experience luck, and considering characters' beliefs about chance and fate, we can create meaningful moments of serendipity that enrich our stories.

    <span><strong>My Writing Essentials:</strong></span>
    <p>I've compiled my comprehensive list of writing essentials, from hardware to software that I use daily. My toolkit starts with a Macbook Pro and includes a mix of traditional writing tools like Scrivener and innovative AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Sudowrite. I rely on multiple organizational tools including Logseq, Notion, and specialized writing software like NovelCrafter and Dramatica Story Expert. While some might question certain choices (especially the AI tools), each serves a specific purpose in my writing process. I've included direct links to help you explore these tools yourself.<br />

    <span><strong>Zombies - An Exercise</strong></span>
    <p>I explore how mob mentality can be reimagined beyond traditional zombie narratives, appearing as anything from social media swarms to sports fanatics. By examining different aspects of mob dynamics - from their inherent weaknesses to potential "cures" for collective madness - I provide a framework for writers to create compelling crowd-based conflicts. Through exercises focused on developing expert characters, exploring survivor strategies, understanding mob leadership, and establishing personal connections within the mob, I demonstrate how these elements can add depth to stories about mass movements and collective behavior.<br />

    <span><strong>The Beat of the Day - A Care Parcel</strong></span>
    <p>I explore the concept of a Care Parcel - a pre-existing relationship that defines and humanizes the protagonist. This storytelling element serves multiple purposes, it helps readers connect emotionally with the main character, reveals their flaws, and establishes what they're willing to fight for. Importantly, I emphasize that this relationship must exist before the story begins to create authentic emotional stakes.<br />

    <span><strong>Tubulent Timelines - A Time Traveling Outline</strong></span>
    <p>I've designed this outline to help craft compelling alternate history narratives that explore how pivotal moments of change can reshape our world. The structure guides you through building a richly detailed alternate timeline while following your protagonist's journey of discovery within it. Each beat carefully balances worldbuilding with character development, from the initial shock of displacement to the final reflection on how choices shape history.<br />

    <span><strong>The Plot Machine - An Outline:</strong></span>
    <p>This "Plot Machine" is a detailed roadmap for crafting compelling narratives, breaking down each crucial story beat from the opening world-building through to the final glimpses of what lies ahead. Each stage carefully builds upon the last, guiding characters through their transformation - from their initial choice through darkness and temptation, up to clarity and growth. While the framework is comprehensive, it's flexible enough to adapt to any genre while maintaining the emotional core of your story's journey.<br />

    <span><strong>With a Purpose:</strong></span>
    <p>Starting this blog was inspired by my desire to help fellow writers avoid unnecessary expenses on their publishing journey. With my husband's support in teaching me website management, I'm creating a space to review writing systems and courses. My goal is to help new authors make informed decisions about where to invest their money, saving their resources for what really matters - getting their work published. Think of this as your guide to navigating the writing industry without breaking the bank.<br />

    <span><strong>A Heart to Heart - An Exercise</strong></span>
    <p>I've created an exercise exploring how heart-to-heart conversations can reveal deeper character motivations and relationships, particularly between protagonists and antagonists. While these intimate dialogues might not all make it into the final story, they're valuable tools for understanding what drives your characters. Through exploring potential confidants, safe locations for honest discussions, and examining how these conversations might shift power dynamics or trigger personal growth, we can uncover new plot complications and character insights. The exercise includes specific prompts to help craft these revealing dialogue scenes.<br />

    <span><strong>The Story Beat of the Day - Retroactive Continuity (RetCon)</strong></span>
    <p>I explain Retroactive Continuity (RetCon) - the practice of adding or reframing past events to serve current plot needs. Using the example of a suddenly-existing space elevator, I describe how RetCons differ from planned reveals. While the best RetCons smoothly integrate into existing narrative without contradictions, I express my personal dislike for this storytelling device, even when it's used to clarify previous plot points.<br />

    <span><strong>A Call to Adventure - An Adventurous Outline</strong></span>
    <p>I've broken down Campbell's archetypal narrative pattern into its essential stages, from the protagonist's ordinary existence through their transformative journey and ultimate return. Each stage is carefully structured to show both external challenges and internal growth, mapping out how characters evolve from reluctant heroes to transformed individuals. While this framework is rooted in ancient mythology, I've detailed how it remains relevant for modern storytelling across all genres, providing a proven template for crafting compelling character arcs and meaningful transformations.<br />

    <span><strong>Shattered Innocence - An Outline</strong></span>
    <p>I've structured this outline to explore the devastating impact of a child's disappearance through multiple perspectives - the anguished parents, the haunted detective, and the fractured community. Each act carefully builds tension while delving into the psychological toll on all involved, from the initial vanishing through to the lasting aftermath. The framework balances the investigative elements with deep emotional resonance, guiding writers through crafting both the external search and the internal struggles that persist even after resolution.<br />

    <span><strong>A Call to Adventure - An Exercise:</strong></span>
    <p>I explore how taking characters out of their comfort zones can drive powerful character development and story progression. Whether it's a Viking landing in Australia or a character making a difficult call home, these shifts in environment create opportunities for growth and transformation. Through exercises examining past travels, potential escape routes, and new challenging settings, I demonstrate how location changes can be more than just scenery - they're catalysts for character evolution. By considering both physical and emotional challenges in new environments, along with the impact of supporting characters, we can create more dynamic and engaging story arcs.<br />

    <span><strong>Is AI a Threat to the Writer&#39;s Sphere?</strong></span>
    <p>I explore why AI isn't the main threat to writers today – instead, it's the overwhelming number of authors competing for limited attention. While my own novels remain unpublished, I've identified an opportunity in helping other writers achieve their publishing goals through digital content and courses. Rather than viewing this as giving up on fiction, I see it as a path that could eventually enable both my writing and teaching aspirations.<br />
