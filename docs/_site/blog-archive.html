    <span><strong>Move Ahead Three Spaces - An Exercise</strong></span>
    <p>Advancing the narrative by jumping forward in time provides a unique opportunity to reposition your characters within the overarching story, offering a chance to showcase the consequences of their actions. It’s akin to the closing of a curtain between acts in a theatrical performance, allowing for a shift in narrative styles, settings, and the progression of seasons.

    <p>A Character Driven Journey:
In narratology and comparative mythology, the hero’s journey, or the monomyth, is the common template of stories that involve a hero who goes on an adventure, is victorious in a decisive crisis, and comes home changed or transformed.

    <span><strong>Killing Your Darlings</strong></span>
    <p>The decision to kill your protagonist in the middle of your story is a bold and impactful narrative choice that can have profound implications for the plot, character development, and thematic exploration. While it’s not a decision to be taken lightly, there are scenarios where it can be a great idea. Let’s explore the reasons why this might be one of those times:

    <span><strong>The Beat of the Day - Antici... pation</strong></span>
    <p>I explore the concept of Strange Attractors in storytelling - the unique, odd elements that hook readers beyond the familiar. Using the example of multiverse pirates, I demonstrate how combining familiar concepts with strange elements creates compelling narratives. However, I emphasize that these strange elements must pay off by the story's end, as audiences have grown wary of unfulfilled setups. Importantly, what's strange today may become familiar tomorrow, pushing writers to constantly innovate.<br />

    <span><strong>The Story Beat of the Day - The Empty Quiver</strong></span>
    <p>I discuss the "Empty Quiver" trope - a storytelling device where characters race to recover a missing powerful weapon before it falls into the wrong hands. Originally a US military code for missing nuclear weapons, this plot device creates instant tension and urgency in narratives. Whether it's the protagonist or antagonist pursuing the weapon, this story beat drives action and raises dramatic stakes.<br />

    <span><strong>The Tragic Plot Embryo</strong></span>
    <p>The Tragic Plot Embryo:
Created by Rachael Stephen, this is an adaptation of Dan Harmon’s story circle in which the character doesn’t learn enough to achieve their desire or goal. In other words, they don’t return to their familiar situation and they don’t transform into something better.
 
Accordingly, it has only the first six steps:
 
You:
The character is in a comfortable place, but has a serious flaw that will prevent them from learning or transforming.
 
Anticipation:
There is a desire or goal they want to achieve, moral or immoral.
 
Dream:
During the search for the goal, a challenging situation occurs and characters are opposed by hostile forces.
 
Frustration:
They adapt to that new situation and continue to fight those opposing forces.
 
Nightmare:
The characters learn that they can achieve their goal, but at an intolerable price.
 
Destruction:
The extremely high price is paid and they never get to return to their comfortable place
 
No Return:
The person that the character was before will never be again.

    <span><strong>Body Horror Writing Prompts</strong></span>
    <p>I present five body horror writing prompts exploring themes of grotesque transformation, from a fertility crisis spawning monstrous offspring to ritualistic body modification in a remote village. Each prompt delves into different aspects of body horror - experimental birthing, organ theft, corpse recycling, cultish bone grafting, and human-animal hybridization. These scenarios aim to inspire writers to explore the darker aspects of body transformation and societal collapse through horror fiction.<br />

    <span><strong>A Pyrrhic Victory - The Beat of the Day</strong></span>
    <p>I explore the concept of Pyrrhic victory - a win that comes at such a devastating cost that its value becomes questionable. Named after King Pyrrhus's costly triumph over the Romans in 279 BCE, this storytelling device adds depth by examining the true price of victory. While often applied to heroes, I note how villains frequently suffer this fate too, demonstrating the futility of evil. It's a powerful way to explore the complex moral implications and lasting trauma of conflict.<br />

    <span><strong>What If... An Exercise</strong></span>
    <p>What If…
Asking the question ‘What if?’ provides a neat framework for the ideas spilling from you brain, which can often be chaotic. It is a way to give your creativity free rein. It is also a way to provide your daydreaming a purpose. ‘What if?’ Two simple words, one simple question and an important step in the creative process. It truly is a helpful tool for writers to use at almost any point in their writing. In fact, I’d go as far as to say that it is going to be one of the most important writing strategies you’ll ever use.

While the basic structure is simple, mastering the art of reveals - whether through character epiphanies or power discoveries - requires skill in execution. Though seemingly straightforward in concept, I explain that combining this with other techniques can create more impactful and memorable moments in writing.<br />

While these moments can powerfully convey themes and truths through emotional learning rather than mere instruction, I caution against overuse. The key is ensuring the protagonist's failure leads to genuine understanding rather than simple information transfer, though too many such scenes can feel heavy-handed.<br />

Their wisdom and experience far exceed my own, and their words offer such richness. What I humbly offer here may not be entirely new, but I hope that, through some act of grace, it reaches you in a way that resonates with your own journey—through stories that feel familiar, or at a time when your heart is ready for just this message. If these few words contained within this blog provide even a small amount of help, encouragement, or sustenance for your writer’s heart, I will feel truly honored. I sincerely hope that you have found what you need, discovered some things
you didn’t know, and settled a little more deeply into who you are as a writer.

    <span><strong>Creating Illustrative Scenes - A Writing Exercise</strong></span>
    <p>Creating Illustrative Scenes:
Do you want to create more illustrative scenes?

  Challenge the character in some way (e.g. their assumptions, their skills, their compassion, their bravery, etc. — it’s hard to gauge someone’s strengths and weaknesses until you see how they handle challenges).
  Show the character making a conscious or instinctive decision about how to behave.
  Show the character in another environment (compared to previous scenes) — we act differently around our buddies than we do at work, and we act differently when we are in charge than when we are the subordinate (show us a new aspect of the character).
  Lastly, show the character in a similar scene to previously but making a different choice to last time — if it’s apparent why there’s a change, this either shows complexity of character or character growth.

There’s no one way to plot a romance. Everyone has their own system of structuring. Romancing the Beat by Gwen Hayes is a popular one many romance writers swear by.

Below is the structure I’ve come up with for myself, but I’m not necessarily telling you to follow it. This is one example. Go forth and search for or create your own should you so choose not to use the one I’ve provided. The choice is yours!

    <p>Perhaps your protagonist and the antagonist are not as far apart as they believe, or perhaps it’s much worse than either of them ever could have realized. Only a heart to heart conversation will make it clear. Sometimes, it’s a stranger that your protagonist opens up to first, revealing the need for a conversation that they didn’t realize before. Granted, these conversations may never make it into the story, but they can reveal what’s driving your protagonist (and the antagonist) in the moment and foreshadow future events or introduce new complications to the plot. It may also give you useful dialogue. So don’t hold back. Allow them to take a deep breath and get everything off their chests.
