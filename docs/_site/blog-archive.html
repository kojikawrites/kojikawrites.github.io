    <span><strong>That Was Lucky - An Exercise</strong></span>
    <p>Embracing serendipity is a quintessential element in storytelling, mirroring the unpredictability of life itself. There’s an undeniable allure in your characters experiencing that elusive stroke of good fortune. It’s the spark that ignites our imaginations, creating those memorable moments that etch themselves into our minds. Both in the realm of fiction and reality, the concept of being in the right place at the right time is a powerful driving force.

    <p>I apologize, I won’t be bringing you a course or book review today. I have found a four and a half hour “writing better scenes” course though, that I will hopefully be reviewing tomorrow (I’ll try to listen to a good portion of it tonight and then the last bit tomorrow morning). Please bare with me as I work out these scheduling issues. I’ll have something for you tomorrow, I hope.

    <p>Who doesn’t have ADHD these days?
I have a thousand (yes, I said a thousand) or so unfinished stories, all awaiting their turn in the work rotation. Recently I was prescribed medication for my ADHD and it’s actually helping. I finished my first children’s book and I have now moved forward with my Space Opera story that’s been burring a hole in my brain.

    <span><strong>Seeking Grace</strong></span>
    <p>My message to fellow authors, I am deeply grateful to the many writers who have shared profound insights about the practice of writing—Mark Tufo, Stephen King, Craig DiLouie, and so many others. Their wisdom and experience far exceed my own, and their words offer such richness. What I humbly offer here may not be entirely new, but I hope that, through some act of grace, it reaches you in a way that resonates with your own journey—through stories that feel familiar, or at a time when your heart is ready for just this message. If these few words contained within this blog provide even a small amount of help, encouragement, or sustenance for your writer’s heart, I will feel truly honored. I sincerely hope that you have found what you need, discovered some things
you didn’t know, and settled a little more deeply into who you are as a writer.

    <span><strong>Creating Illustrative Scenes - A Writing Exercise</strong></span>
    <p>Do you want to create more illustrative scenes?

  Challenge the character in some way (e.g. their assumptions, their skills, their compassion, their bravery, etc. — it’s hard to gauge someone’s strengths and weaknesses until you see how they handle challenges).
  Show the character making a conscious or instinctive decision about how to behave.
  Show the character in another environment (compared to previous scenes) — we act differently around our buddies than we do at work, and we act differently when we are in charge than when we are the subordinate (show us a new aspect of the character).
  Lastly, show the character in a similar scene to previously but making a different choice to last time — if it’s apparent why there’s a change, this either shows complexity of character or character growth.

    <span><strong>Love is in the Air - A Romantic Outline:</strong></span>
    <p>Love is in the Air:
There’s no one way to plot a romance. Everyone has their own system of structuring. Romancing the Beat by Gwen Hayes is a popular one many romance writers swear by. I’m not great at following anyone else’s mold. The way I work is by making things up for myself and finding the way I need to do things. Below is the structure I’ve come up with for myself, but I’m not necessarily telling you to follow it. This is one example. Go forth and search for or create your own should you so choose not to use the one I’ve provided. The choice is yours!

    <p>When I told my husband that I wanted to create a website/blog, he was very supportive and was more than ready and willing to teach me how to do it and how to maintain it on my own, and while I don’t have everything involved committed to memory at the time that this post goes live, I do know that if I have any questions, he’s going to do his best to answer them and show me how to do what I’m asking for.

    <p>A Heart to Heart:
Perhaps your protagonist and the antagonist are not as far apart as they believe, or perhaps it’s much worse than either of them ever could have realized. Only a heart to heart conversation will make it clear. Sometimes, it’s a stranger that your protagonist opens up to first, revealing the need for a conversation that they didn’t realize before. Granted, these conversations may never make it into the story, but they can reveal what’s driving your protagonist (and the antagonist) in the moment and foreshadow future events or introduce new complications to the plot. It may also give you useful dialogue. So don’t hold back. Allow them to take a deep breath and get everything off their chests.
