        <h2>hiive</h2>
        <p>
            hiive is an ex-UK resident who currently lives in a bunker located in places unknown. He has a BSc in
            Physics, an MSc in ML/AI, and currently earns his keep as a Lead Data Engineer and Subject-Matter Expert
            (SME) for the use of ML/AI in medical research and other fields.
        </p>
        <p>
            hiive has written several books, all connected in some way or other with his love of games. The most notable
            of these being a very well-received book on game architecture and design, which has been the reference for
            many college and secondary education courses. In his spare time, you may see him working on games.
            He, sadly, does not have much time to play them anymore.
            He has been writing software professionally for since the last millennium, and is knowledgeable across a
            wide range of industries and programming languages, ranging from BASIC and Z80 assembler in the early days,
            through C/C++, and out the other side to Python, C# and (more recently) Rust.
        </p>

            Note that his avatar is not really what he actually looks like. However, it is what AI thinks he looks like
            based on a text description and an uploaded photo. He'll take it.

        <p>
            Her avatar is far closer to her real-life appearance than hiive's. We'll take it.
