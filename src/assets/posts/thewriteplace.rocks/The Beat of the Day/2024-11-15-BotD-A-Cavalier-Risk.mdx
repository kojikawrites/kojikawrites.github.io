title:  "The Beat of the Day - A Cavalier Risk"
description: I examine the trope I call "A Cavalier Risk" - that crucial moment when a character's early success breeds dangerous overconfidence. Just before the story's midpoint, protagonists often feel invincible after initial victories, leading them to take reckless actions that set up their downfall. Using metaphors like "poking the bear" and "messing with the bull," I describe how this plot point reveals characters' true nature while setting them up for the harsh lessons waiting at the midpoint. This dance between pride and consequence is essential for character development.

Ego. Hubris. Pride. Narcissism. Solipsism. Self-indulgence. Overconfidence. A big head. Self-absorbed. Self-obsessed. Being a basic asshole. For some reason, whenever life is about to teach us a lesson – it first wants to show us how Much of an asshole we can be when things are going our way. So we’ve waltzed into a surreal underworld, learned a few new rules, made some friends, had a minor victory, and placated those close to us, and it looks like our goal is right on the other side of that summit called “Midpoint.” Things were tough, maybe even, scary for a minute, but now we’re feeling pretty confident – dare I say cocky? Suddenly we’re feeling like we can walk that tightrope, while juggling some babies. Dance with the devil. Poke the bear. Wake the sleeping giant. Turns out we are kind of a badass. There’s this old saying they had in the Army: “You mess with the bull, you get the horns.” It’s almost like Karma is drawing you into a duel and daring you to challenge it. This is often when we begin to see the most candid, unbridled view of the character. Usually this plot point is like the set up for the spike. The Cavalier Risk is when we set up the protagonist. The Midpoint is when they get spiked. In other words you mess with the bull in Plot Point 11 and you get the horns in Plot Point 12.
