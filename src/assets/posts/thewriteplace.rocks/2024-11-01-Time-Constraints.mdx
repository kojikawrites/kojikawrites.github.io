title: Time Constraints
description: >-
  Today was dedicated to behind-the-scenes work - fixing formatting issues and improving
  descriptions across my older posts rather than creating new content. While this
  means I won't meet my usual posting goals, these updates were necessary to improve
  the overall quality of the blog. I should be back to regular posting tomorrow, once
  all these edits are properly in place.

I hate behind-the-scenes days. Most of the time it's tedious and boring as fuck. All you do is fix shit.
