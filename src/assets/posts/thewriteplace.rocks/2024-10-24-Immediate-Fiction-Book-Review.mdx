title:  "Immediate Fiction - A Book Review"
description: |
    I recently reviewed Jerry Cleaver's "Immediate Fiction," a comprehensive writing guide that covers everything from
    initial story development to manuscript submission. While it's particularly valuable for pantser-style writers
    (those who write by the seat of their pants), I still recommend it to all fiction writers despite being a plotter
    myself. At around $15 for paperback or $11 for Kindle, this three-star book offers useful insights into managing
    writing time, overcoming blocks, and mastering the revision process with its "Write what you can imagine" approach.

### Immediate Fiction written by Jerry Cleaver:
Covering the entire process from story building to manuscript preparation and marketing, Jerry Cleaver shows the novice and experienced writer how to start writing and how to get immediate results.

Readers will find everything they need to know about managing time, finding an idea, getting the first word down on the page, staying unblocked, shaping ideas into compelling stories, and submitting their work to agents and publishers.

Immediate Fiction goes beyond the old "Write what you know" to "Write what you can imagine." Filled with insightful tips on how to manage doubts, fears, blocks, and panic, Immediate Fiction will help writers develop their skills in as little minutes a day, if necessary.

Believing that all writing is rewriting, Cleaver says, "You can't control what you put on the page. You can only control what you leave on the page." With this book Cleaver shows how to get that control and produce results.

You can pick this gem up on Amazon for around fifteen dollars for paperback and eleven dollars for the Kindle version.

### My Overall Rating:
⭐ ⭐ ⭐

This is a great book for pantsers. As I am a plotter, it isn't really written with me in mind. HOWEVER, it is still a book that I would recommend anyone wanting to learn how to go about writing fiction, to read.
