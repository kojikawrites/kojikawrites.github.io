title:  "Today's Thoughts"
description: In this daily reflection post, I share both the challenges and bright moments of my day. Despite dealing with chronic pain, late starts, and worried moments about my four-year-old's health, I found joy in unexpected places - like a rare "I love you" from my teenager and some meaningful progress with my work. I'm learning to acknowledge both the ups and downs, celebrating small victories like managing to eat a bit more than usual. This kind of honest daily check-in helps me stay grounded and might become a regular feature of my blog.

## My Positives:
I have forty-one posts on my website and I couldn't be happier about the way it's turning out.
I spent quality time with my kids

## My Negatives:
I didn't eat enough.

## My Thoughts on Today:
I am overall in a good mood today. I've gotten a lot of work done today too.

My pain levels are a bit high, but I am very happy that I did not require a nap today. I've gotten some transfers and writing done. I was able to play with my kids too. So, I would consider this a successful day.

I haven't eaten very much today though. It's something I really need to work on, if I am going to get the green light from my oncologist to yank the feeding tube. I am trying, it's just so hard to eat, these days. Too, I didn't have the tube feed on today, and I think that, that was a mistake. I'll have to be on it all day tomorrow, as I know that I didn't get enough nutrition today.

Regarding sleep, I am going to try to make it an early night, tonight. I want to be in bed and under nine blankets, with my meds done before midnight.

Here's to tomorrow being as good as today or better. Oh yeah, and FUCK CANCER...
