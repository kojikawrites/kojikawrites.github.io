title: "Surviving Loss"
description: I explore different forms of loss and their impact on character development, from death of loved ones to loss of freedom or innocence. By examining how these experiences connect to basic human needs like self-actualization and belonging, I provide a framework for understanding character motivation and growth through grief. I break down the preparatory steps characters might take to overcome loss, potential sacrifices they'll face, and roadblocks they'll encounter, while emphasizing the high stakes of failing to process grief properly. This helps writers craft more authentic character arcs around themes of loss and recovery.

Some Forms This May Take:
Experiencing the death of a loved one.
Experiencing a divorce or break up.
Losing one's job.
Realizing the death of a dream.
Losing one's home.
Loss of one's health via a devastating diagnosis or accident.
Losing a limb or one of the five senses.
Experiencing a loss of mental aptitude.
Losing one's freedom—through incarceration, being enslaved, because of an oppressive ruling regime, being placed in an assisted living facility, etc.
Being banished from a group, family, church, etc.
Losing one's innocence, through disillusionment, being let down by someone, abuse, or some other means.

Human Need Driving the Goal (Inner Motivation):
There are five basic human needs that, when missing from a character's life, could motivate them to pursue this goal. The following needs are all possibilities, but only one of them should be the primary driver for any given character. For more information on the relationship between human needs and outer motivations, please see this Character Motivation tutorial.

Self-Actualization: If a character realizes that their response to a loss is keeping them from achieving their goals and dreams, they may be motivated to face their loss and adjust their response to it.
Esteem and Recognition: Many times, a loss can impact a character's sense of self-worth. This can happen when someone loses a job or lover or something for which they feel culpable. When they reach rock bottom and decide they want to feel better about themselves, they may choose to address their situation.
Love and Belonging: Every one responds differently to grief. If a character's reaction to loss has resulted in them becoming isolated or disconnected from others, they may realize their need to address their loss in order to regain that connection with others.
Safety and Security: Grief can hit some people harder than others. If a character's health or well-being is impacted, they may find themselves pursing the goal of dealing with their loss in a healthier way.

How the Character May Prepare For This Goal:
Getting in touch with one's feelings.
Being honest with oneself about the circumstances leading up to the loss (and one's possible part in it).
Forgiving oneself or others.
Turning away from one's negative or harmful responses to the loss.
Recognizing that life can go on without the person or thing one has lost.
Realizing that one does, indeed, want to go on, even without the person or thing that was lost.
Finding a positive outlet for dealing with stress and emotions.
Taking steps to replace what was lost (getting another pet, interviewing for a new job, beginning to date again, etc.).
Seeking counseling or joining a support group.
Determining to find joy in the little things.
Caring for oneself, both physically and emotionally.
Embracing positivity and hope.

Possible Sacrifices or Costs Associated With This Goal:
Having to face the emotions and memories one has tried to forget.
Experiencing guilt and feelings of disloyalty as one moves beyond the lost person or thing.
Having to face life without the person or thing that was so important.

Roadblocks Which Could Prevent This Goal From Being Achieved:
The negative emotions and memories that accompany grief.
Well-meaning loved ones who say the wrong things.
Addictions and negative habits that make it difficult for one to move forward.
Anniversaries and other benchmarks that freshen one's grief.
Depression, anxiety, PTSD, and other mental disorders resulting from the loss.

What is at Stake if This Goal Isn't Met?:
Never getting past the loss.
Declining into mental illness.
Developing addictions and other harmful behaviors.
