title:  "I'm Very, VERY Sorry"
description: After a twenty-two-day hiatus due to health issues and Thanksgiving that made posting feel overwhelming, I'm finally feeling well enough to get back to writing. Sometimes we need to listen to our bodies and take breaks, but now I'm ready to resume sharing content with you all.

It's been twenty-two days... and I haven't posted anything.

I haven't felt well and posting felt daunting, so I didn't do it. Now, however, I am feeling a bit better, so I am going to attempt to post.

Thanksgiving was great. Great food, great company.

Meanwhile, my partner has been working on a new way of creating this website, so expect a huge update in the coming month or so.
