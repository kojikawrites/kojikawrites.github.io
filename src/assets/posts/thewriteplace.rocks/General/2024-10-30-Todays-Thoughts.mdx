title:  "Today's Thoughts"
description: In this daily reflection post, I share both the challenges and bright moments of my day. Despite dealing with chronic pain, late starts, and worried moments about my four-year-old's health, I found joy in unexpected places - like a rare "I love you" from my teenager and some meaningful progress with my work. I'm learning to acknowledge both the ups and downs, celebrating small victories like managing to eat a bit more than usual. This kind of honest daily check-in helps me stay grounded and might become a regular feature of my blog.

### Not everyday can be a total success...

### My Negatives:
- I was feeling inadequate comparing my website to that of my husband's. When I tell you that he is a smart man, I mean it. He knows how to make this shit look amazing.
- Pain was a bit topsy-turvy today.
- I want to post more, however I am exhausted. I may go to bed soon. Again, I have to remind myself that slow and steady wins the rade.

### My Positives:
- CARAMEL BANANA GELATO!
- I received a lot of affection from my son today, complete with hugs and kisses and I love yous. It was great.
- As of today I've done sixty-eight posts. I feel pretty good about that.
- I have to remind myself that I have enough unpublished content to post for the next five years or more, so I need to do a better job at pacing myself.
- I was thinking about my names post and I think I want to redo it as twenty-six posts instead.

### My Thoughts on Today:
I think I am putting too much pressure on myself regarding this website. I think I just simply need to do whatever I can and stop focusing on the things that didn't get posted yet. It's going to become a chore if I continue to see it like I have been. I just need to post what I can and not worry about a stupid made up quota.
