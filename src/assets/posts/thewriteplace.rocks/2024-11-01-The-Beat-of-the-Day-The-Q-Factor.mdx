title: The Beat of the Day - The Q-Factor
description: >-
  I explain the Q-Factor - a powerful storytelling technique where an emotional element,
  introduced early in the story, returns at the protagonist's darkest moment to help
  them overcome their fears and challenges. By establishing this element in Act One,
  subtly referencing it mid-story, and bringing it back at a crucial moment, we can
  create deeply resonant scenes without heavy-handed explanation. Through a five-step
  process, I demonstrate how to effectively weave this device into your narrative,
  making those rock-bottom moments more impactful and meaningful.

The Q-Factor is a memorable moment that reinforces the hero immediately after they’ve hit rock bottom. Lights Out and other darkest hours. To make this scene memorable in the ending payoff, however, you’ll want to set it up early in your novel (preferably act one), and later draw subtle attention again somewhere in the middle, though don’t push attention on this device, person, feeling, or message. Let it breathe in its own spectacular inhale that will prove the most powerful exhale at the Q-Factor moment. Think of it this way. So many stories are about the overcoming of fear. The fear manifests itself most when all the forces are marshaled against the Lead. Fear and common sense tell her to give up, run away. A Q Factor is an emotional element that comes in when your protagonist (or other characters) needs it.

1. Select what the element will be (item, mentor, moral sentiment, negative character, etc.)
2. Write a scene early in the narrative that anchors this element emotionally to the Lead.
3. Refer to the Q Factor once in the middle section, as a reminder.
   You should do this subtly, almost as a throwaway.
4. Find a trigger point in the Lead's darkest hour where the Q Factor can be reintroduced.
5. Show the Lead taking new action based on the Q Factor. If you've embedded the Q well enough up front, the readers will pick up what's happening without you having to explain it to them. Just let it happen naturally.

The Q in this case is the emotional impetus set up in Act 1 that comes back in Act 3 to provide inspiration or instruction. Sometimes this is physical help. Fear makes the protagonist run but the Q factor makes him or her stay.

TIP: Brainstorm Q factors for Act 3, then go back and write the scenes to plant them into Act 1.
