title: A Tragic Greek Salad - An Outline
description: >-
  This outline breaks down the essential elements of Greek tragedy into six key components,
  from the initial hubris to the final catharsis. I've structured it to be integrated
  within your existing story outline, helping you weave these classical elements into
  your narrative. Each component builds upon the last - from character flaws to dramatic
  reversals - creating that satisfying emotional arc that makes tragic stories so
  compelling.

## A Tragic Greek Salad:
This particular outline is designed to be integrated into an already existing outline.

### Hubris:
Hubris is fancy little word that insinuates that the protagonist is a little full of themselves.

### Hamartia:
Hamartia is an Ancient Greek word that means "to miss the mark" or "to err". In layman’s terms, it means that there’s a critical flaw present that is causing the protagonist’s downfall (temporarily or permanently speaking).

### Peripeteia:
A sudden reversal of fortune or change in circumstances, especially in reference to fictional narrative.

### Anagnorisis:
Yet another one of Aristotle’s words. This one describes the act of the protagonist making a critical discovery. This could include a principal character recognizing or discovering another character's true identity, discovering the true nature of their own circumstances, or finding a tangible object that is somehow crucial to the story.

### Nemesis:
You may be more familiar with this thought. The fact that a protagonist should always have a nemesis, or some kind of punishment that they can’t avoid.

### Catharsis:
This is another more familiar Ancient Greek word. This word insinuates that the ending of your story provides a process of releasing, and thereby providing relief from, strong or repressed emotions.
