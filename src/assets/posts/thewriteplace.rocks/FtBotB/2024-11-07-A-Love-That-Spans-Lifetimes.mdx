### Working Title:
Whispers of Forever

### Story Synopsis:
MacColl Albers has lived for millennia, burdened by the curse of immortality. What others might see as a gift has brought him more pain than joy. He has fought in humanity's bloodiest wars, witnessed the rise and fall of countless civilizations, and loved and lost more times than he dares to remember. His eternal life has become a monotonous drift through time, punctuated by heartbreak and loss. Yet nothing in his long existence could prepare him for Isolde Ciernik.

When Mac meets Isolde, a vivacious art historian with an infectious passion for life, he feels truly alive for the first time in decades. Her joyful spirit and sharp mind awaken parts of him he thought were long dead. For the first time, Mac begins to make plans for the future instead of merely surviving the endless march of time. In Isolde, he dares to hope he has finally found someone to spend eternity with.

But just as happiness seems within reach, Isolde disappears without a trace. Consumed with worry, Mac throws himself into the search, joining the efforts to comb the city for her. Her disappearance dredges up memories of loved ones lost over the centuries—people he couldn't save, no matter how desperately he tried. As hours turn into days with no sign of Isolde, Mac's worst fears take hold: that he is cursed to lose everyone he loves.

Determined to break this cruel cycle, Mac uses his centuries of knowledge and the extensive connections he has cultivated to investigate Isolde's disappearance. Clues lead him to suspect she may have been targeted for a rare medieval manuscript she recently authenticated—a discovery that had caught the attention of dangerous individuals. The search forces Mac to confront enemies from his past, including those who know the truth about his immortality. He descends into a dark and treacherous criminal underworld where ancient grudges and modern greed collide.

As the stakes grow higher, Mac finds himself grappling with the weight of his immortality. The endless years have given him unparalleled knowledge and skills, but they also remind him of every failure, every loss. Isolde has become more than just another chapter in his long life; she represents the possibility of breaking free from the cycle of despair and loneliness. Yet doubts gnaw at him: Can he protect her when he couldn't save so many others? Is his love strong enough to withstand the test of time, or will his immortality once again cost him everything?

Mac’s journey to find Isolde becomes not only a fight to save her life but also a battle for his own soul. For the first time in centuries, he knows one thing for certain—he no longer wishes to die. As he risks everything to rescue Isolde and confront the dark forces threatening her, Mac must decide whether his love is worth defying the curse that has shadowed him for so long.

In the end, Mac discovers that immortality is not just a burden but also an opportunity. Isolde’s disappearance becomes a catalyst for him to reclaim his humanity, proving that even a man who has lived for millennia can find a reason to keep going, a purpose to keep fighting, and a love worth living for.
