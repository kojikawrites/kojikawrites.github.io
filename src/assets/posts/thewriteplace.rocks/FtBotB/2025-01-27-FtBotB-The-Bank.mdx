### From the Back of the Book:

### Working Title:
The Bank

### Story Synopsis:
Many years ago, the world's top scientists created a way by which to take the talents and experience from one person and give them to another. If a person dies or is convicted of a crime, their talents and experiences can be given to someone else or placed in The E/T Bank. At first it was solely used in the military, but now it's use has expanded and the general public has access, at a great monetary cost, though several lotteries have been set up as a way to make it more widely available.

Topher Broderick thought he was living an ordinary life - working a mundane office job by day and coming home to his loving parents and baby sisters each night. But when he returns from work one evening to find his childhood home ransacked, his parents murdered, and his sisters Iyanla and Dalary gone without a trace, Topher's world is turned upside down in an instant.

Left in place of his sisters is a chilling note from their captor: a list of experiences and talents Topher must acquire and transfer via the E/T Bank if he ever wants to see his sisters again unharmed. Abilities like martial arts expertise, weapons proficiency, infiltration skills - things wholly outside Topher's current skillset as an average citizen. He realizes with dawning horror that his sisters have been taken by someone intent on harvesting their talents once they come of age - talents they could only have inherited from their late parents. Talents this sinister person now demands from Topher instead.

With time ticking down until the kidnapper's deadline, Topher plunges into the shady underworld of the E/T Bank, risking his life and very identity to illegally purchase and transfer the experiences necessary to rescue his sisters. But acquiring these talents comes at a steep price, both financially and morally. Topher is forced to turn to a life of crime to pay for the expensive E/T transfers, constantly evading capture from the authorities who have outlawed such unauthorized transfers.

As he becomes more proficient in subterfuge and combat, Topher struggles to hold onto his sense of self. With each new ability gained, he fears he is losing a piece of his soul. But with his sisters' lives hanging in the balance, he pushes forward obsessively, driven by desperation, love, and a simmering hunger for vengeance.

When the fateful day finally arrives, Topher comes face to face with his parents' killer, ready to reclaim his sisters - and unleash his deadly new skills. But the kidnapper has one final twist in store, a revelation that will turn Topher's world upside down yet again... Topher has a brother that he never knew about…

The high stakes race against time, the moral dilemmas, the tests of clashing identities and sibling love - these elements could make for a compelling sci-fi thriller exploring the dark side of talent transference technology and the lengths one man will go to for family.
