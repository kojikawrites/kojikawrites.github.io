### From the Back of the Book:

### Working Title:
Time's Thesis

### Story Synopsis:
Gabrie Mortan seems like an average graduate student on the surface, but he harbors a fascination with the theoretical concept of time travel. For his thesis, he decides to conduct an ambitious study scanning the internet for evidence of historical events being discussed prior to when they actually occurred—proof that someone with knowledge of the future traveled back in time and leaked details. Gabrie's professors dismiss the idea as fanciful, and his peers ridicule the premise, believing it to be a waste of time. However, Gabrie is determined, spending long hours scouring online archives and obscure forums. One day, he uncovers something extraordinary—repeated mentions from a user named Klotilde Lydian accurately describing major events, months before they happen.

Gabrie quickly becomes obsessed with exposing Klotilde's identity and convincing others of his incredible finding. Through clever research, he is finally able to track her down, revealing that she is not of this time but from a distant future era. Klotilde is alarmed that her secret has been discovered. As Gabrie presses to make his findings public, Klotilde desperately tries to convince him of the immense dangers associated with that course of action. She reveals that she was sent back in time by a shadowy future organization attempting to subtly influence key moments in history. While their intentions are seemingly benign, she warns that revealing her identity and the existence of time travel could have catastrophic unforeseen consequences. However, the ambitious Gabrie is not easily deterred. He sees only fame and glory from exposing what he believes to be the story of the century and proving all his naysayers wrong.

As he moves forward with his plan, Klotilde resorts to bold and risky measures to preserve the secrecy of her true origins. Gabrie also faces opposition from powerful forces. His professors fear embarrassment and ridicule within the academic community should he come forward with such an outrageous claim. Government agents begin to monitor him closely, concerned about potential national security implications.

As Gabrie gets closer to revealing the truth to the world, the stakes rise even higher. Friendships are tested, unknown dangers emerge, and both Gabrie's and Klotilde's lives are put at risk on their dangerous quest to prove the impossible. They find themselves wrestling with profound questions: Do some secrets require protection at any cost? And if one possesses knowledge of future events, does he also shoulder the moral burden of preventing disaster? In the end, both must make bold sacrifices for what they feel is the greater good in this time travel thriller packed with suspense, intrigue, and thought-provoking concepts.
