title:  "FtBotB - Classroom Consequences"
description: I've developed a story examining institutional failure and systematic abuse through the character of Zivit Suhny, a student pushed to her breaking point after years of trauma at Gregory Hautum High School. Following her sexual assault by a history teacher and subsequent gaslighting by school administration, my narrative explores how continued institutional betrayal and denial can lead to devastating consequences. Through Zivit's story, I confront difficult themes about power dynamics, accountability, and the dire effects of ignoring victims' voices in educational settings.

## From the Back of the Book:
## Working Title:
Classroom Consequences
&nbsp;
## Story Synopsis:
After years of false rumors, hushed whispers among teachers and staff, physical assaults in the halls and in class, a forced sexual encounter by her history teacher, and the outright gaslighting and denial displayed by the principal after she reported the assault, Zivit Suhny has finally reached her breaking point.

As she sits in the utility closet and loads the dozens of magazines for the four stolen semi-automatic weapons on her lap, she remembers every touch, every taunt, every whisper. She knows what she must do. Today, the teachers and the staff of Gregory Hautum High School are going to reap what they’ve sown over the past three and a half years.

She is disgusted by their behavior. She knows that she’s not the only student that this has happened to. She will avenge them too on this day. Today will be the day Zivit will have her revenge for every offense they’ve committed against her. Today will be the day that every single one of them will die. Today will be the day that all of her pain and suffering will finally end.

When she hears the chime of the bell that signifies the beginning of the lunch hour, she smiles as she stands up, placing a full magazine in the chamber of the AR-15 and putting it in the guitar case. Grabbing the door knob, she opens the door and calmly walks out into the main hall.
