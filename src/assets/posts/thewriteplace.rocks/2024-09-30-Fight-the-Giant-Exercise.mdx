title: Fighting the Giant - An Exercise
description: >-
  I've developed a guide on the power of early confrontations in storytelling, explaining
  how immediate conflicts can energize your narrative right from the start. While
  many writers save major showdowns for the finale, I explore how early battles -
  whether victories or defeats - can create compelling story complications and character
  development opportunities. Through questions examining everything from emotional
  stakes to environmental factors, I provide a framework for crafting these early
  confrontations effectively. This approach helps establish stakes quickly while leaving
  room for character growth and unexpected plot developments throughout the story.

# Fighting the Giant:
We usually think of showdowns coming at the end of the story, but early battles allow for new complications.

A crushing defeat early on gives your character something to prove. Do they doubt themselves? Will their allies stand with them? In reverse, a surprising victory could turn an enemy into a new ally, or spawn an even more powerful big bad, perhaps the mother or brother of the defeated foe.

1. Immediate Conflict:
   By pitting your character against one of their adversaries without delay, you thrust them headfirst into the heart of the conflict. This immediate clash can grip readers from the outset, setting the tone for a gripping and action-packed narrative.


2. Establishing Stakes:
   An early confrontation with an adversary can swiftly establish the stakes of the story. Readers witness the danger and challenges that lie ahead, igniting their curiosity and investment in the character's journey.


3. Character Dynamics:
   An early showdown provides an opportunity to delve into the dynamics between the character and their adversaries. It allows readers to witness the initial sparks of rivalry, uncover the motivations driving both characters and anticipate the evolving power struggle.


4. Reader Engagement:
   By presenting one of the character's adversaries early on, you engage readers' imaginations and keep them eagerly turning the pages. They become invested in the outcome of the conflict, eager to see how the character will face this formidable challenge.


5. Foreshadowing:
   An early confrontation can serve as foreshadowing, hinting at the overarching conflict and character arcs that will unfold throughout the story. It sets the narrative wheels in motion, leaving readers with burning questions and a desire to explore what lies ahead.


6. Character Development:
   Facing an adversary early provides a platform for character development. It allows the character to showcase their strengths, weaknesses, and resourcefulness in the face of adversity. Readers witness the character's growth and transformation from the outset.


7. Subverting Expectations:
   Deviating from the more traditional narrative structure can surprise and engage readers. By confronting adversaries immediately, you subvert their expectations and keep them guessing about the twists and turns that could still lie ahead.


8. Immediate Tension Release:
   If your story opens with a suspenseful or tense situation, an early confrontation can provide immediate tension release. It allows you to resolve the initial conflict while introducing a larger, overarching challenge.


9. Hooking Your Audience:
   An early character-adversary showdown can serve as a narrative hook, capturing the audience's attention and compelling them to invest emotionally in the story. It's an invitation to journey alongside the characters as they face formidable obstacles.


Ultimately, choosing to have your character confront an adversary right now can be a bold and effective storytelling choice. It plunges readers into the heart of the action, fosters engagement, and sets the stage for an enthralling narrative filled with twists, character development, and high-stakes conflict.

### The Exercise:
If your character has a plan, how can they be forced to accelerate it? Perhaps they learn new information, or a window of opportunity is closing. Coincidences happen. Brainstorm ways your character and antagonist could find themselves in the same location unexpectedly.

List three ways an enemy could bring the fight to the character right now, no matter how much or how little you’ve written.
