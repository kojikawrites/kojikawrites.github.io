title: FtBotB - A Post Apocalyptic Novel - The Surge
description: >-
  I've developed a post-apocalyptic story that pairs an unlikely duo - a social media-obsessed
  teenager and a grizzled survivalist - in the aftermath of catastrophic solar flares.
  Through Ayres Jorge and Ozman Shaugh's journey, I explore how different generations
  and mindsets might adapt to survive in a world stripped of technology. As they face
  various threats, from looters to warlords, their complementary skills and perspectives
  help them not only survive but eventually lead others in rebuilding society. The
  narrative challenges the typical "hunker down and defend" approach of survival stories,
  suggesting that true hope lies in bringing people together rather than hiding from
  them.

## Working Title:
The Surge

## Story Synopsis:
In the near future, seventeen-year-old Ayres Jorge is a typical teenager—glued to her phone, addicted to social media, and struggling to connect with her distant parents. But her mundane world is shattered in an instant when a series of massive solar flares cripple the planet’s electronics. Planes crash, cars spiral out of control, and the fragile fabric of society disintegrates into chaos overnight. Terrified by the growing violence in her suburban neighborhood, Ayres flees to her secret spot in the wilderness—a place she used to escape the stresses of modern life.

There, she crosses paths with Ozman Shaugh, a grizzled survivalist who’s been preparing for this very scenario his entire life. Ozman immediately recognizes the severity of the situation: they need to get as far away from population centers as possible to avoid the fallout of society’s collapse. Though they come from completely different worlds, Ayres’ digital-era savviness unexpectedly complements Ozman’s rugged survival expertise. The unlikely pair strikes up a tenuous alliance, combining their strengths to navigate this dangerous new reality.

As they journey across the country in search of an isolated refuge, Ayres and Ozman witness the worst of humanity emerging from the wreckage. Roving bands of looters, territorial warlords, and desperate survivors fight for control over dwindling resources. Ayres, optimistic and naive, wants to believe they can simply avoid the rising chaos, but Ozman knows better—no one can hide forever. As they travel, Ozman begins teaching Ayres the skills she’ll need to survive in this hostile world, while Ayres shows him the value of hope and the importance of not giving up on humanity entirely.

When they finally reach Ozman’s bunker, they discover it’s already been claimed by a group of desperate families, led by the ruthless Einar Willis. Einar’s iron-fisted rule prioritizes the security of his group above all else, leaving no room for compromise. Determined to reclaim the bunker, Ayres and Ozman engage in a dangerous battle of wits, relying on strategy and trickery rather than brute force. Their ingenuity pays off, and they succeed in regaining control of the bunker.

But their victory is short-lived. A far greater threat looms on the horizon: Rein Dareios, a brutal warlord intent on building an empire from the ashes of civilization. Rein’s growing army of conscripted survivors has been steadily expanding, and he sees the bunker as a valuable resource for his conquest. Ozman wants to dig in and defend their stronghold, but Ayres argues that isolation is no longer an option. To stand any chance against Rein, they need to think bigger.

Reluctantly, Ozman agrees to Ayres’ plan: a temporary alliance with Einar and his people. Together, they train the families in basic combat and prepare for the inevitable confrontation. During the final battle, Ayres and Ozman’s group employs clever sabotage and outsmarts Rein’s larger, stronger forces. Rein underestimates the resourcefulness of their scrappy militia, and the battle ends in a decisive victory for Ayres and Ozman’s side.

With Rein defeated, Ozman finally understands the truth Ayres has been trying to show him all along: they can’t just hide away and hope the world gets better. If they want to rebuild society, they’ll have to step up and lead the way. Together, the unlikely duo forge a new path into the uncertain future, proving that even in humanity’s darkest days, hope and strength can emerge when brave individuals unite to confront the challenges ahead. Their journey becomes a testament to resilience, ingenuity, and the enduring power of human connection.
