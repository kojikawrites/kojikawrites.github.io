## From the Back of the Book:
## Working Title:
The Kakapo House (Book Three of The Klaite Moran Chronicles)

## Story Synopsis:
After the trauma surrounding Reynel and the Baure case, Klaite desperately needs a retreat to process everything. With her boss Estefany and therapist Lelleann's blessing, she takes a month-long sabbatical in Massachusetts to recover. Hoping to make connections in the quaint town, Klaite meets a man named Jehan Bowen at a coffee shop. Jehan charms her with his talk of bird conservation and invites her to tour his aviary house. Letting her guard down, Klaite eagerly agrees, not realizing Jehan has sinister motives.

Upon entering Jehan's home, Klaite is caught off guard when he violently attacks her with a crowbar. As her cheekbone shatters, she realizes in horror that this man is somehow connected to Reynel. Severely injured and terrified, Klaite finds herself imprisoned by Jehan, Reynel's vengeful son. Jehan blames her for his father’s execution and tarnished reputation due to the Baure case. He delights in confessing his plan to torture her as payback, before finally killing her.

As days of brutal captivity pass, Klaite comes to understand that Jehan has undoubtedly inherited his father’s psychopathic tendencies. Desperate to survive, she uses her interviewing skills to manipulate Jehan and buy herself more time. Playing on his emotional vulnerability, seething rage, and intense need to know more about his father, Klaite slowly gains his trust. She knows the only way out is to keep her wits and try to get help.

Walking a dangerous line, Klaite placates Jehan while secretly contacting Estefany and Lelleann through her hidden iWatch. Back in Los Angeles, Estefany and Lelleann work tirelessly with the FBI, investigating Klaite’s kidnapping and piecing together her cryptic messages.

After twenty-six harrowing days, the FBI finally locates Jehan's house of horrors. In a dramatic raid, they storm the property, rescuing Klaite just in time to save her from a horrific fate. Beaten but not broken, Klaite slowly begins to recover from her ordeal.

Having faced Reynel's depraved legacy yet again, Klaite emerges wiser and even more committed to seeking justice in even the darkest places. She comes to accept that she cannot run from her past—only by confronting the monsters can she reclaim her power and purpose.
