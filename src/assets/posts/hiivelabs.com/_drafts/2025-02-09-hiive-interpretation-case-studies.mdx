        Finally, because I like pictures, here's a couple of non-exhaustive *Rogues Gallery* (see what I did there?) of notable
        roguelikes that I've been known to enjoy playing.

        - ### Traditional Roguelikes: Case Studies
        For many players, the allure of traditional roguelikes lies in their uncompromising approach to challenge and
        consequence. Permadeath rewards patience and planning, pushing players to learn from mistakes and refine their
        strategies. By restricting meta-systems that carry over between runs, these games reinforce the importance of
        moment-to-moment decisions and the organic mastery of complex systems.

        Traditional roguelikes represent the modern descendants most influenced by early genre-defining titles such as
        <WikiLink wiki_id="Rogue_(video_game)">*Rogue*</WikiLink> itself, <WikiLink wiki_id="NetHack">*NetHack*</WikiLink>, and
        <SteamLink steam_id="333300">*ADOM*</SteamLink>. These games adhere closely to the foundational concepts that shaped the
        genre’s formative years, emphasizing discrete, turn-based movement, single-character progression, and harsh penalties
        for failure. In doing so, they uphold the genre’s heritage by focusing on methodical decision-making and
        survival-oriented play rather than reflex-based action or extensive meta-progression.

        The following non-exhaustive list of examples demonstrate these principles:

        - <SteamLink steam_id="333640">*Caves of Qud*</SteamLink>: A modernized traditional roguelike that exemplifies
        emergent complexity and procedural depth (with its "layer cake of thousand-year-old civilizations”).
        Its faction systems and richly simulated world allow for unpredictable, highly personalized experiences.
        Players might encounter a wandering merchant one run and find themselves on the wrong side of their faction the next.
        This variability reinforces the game’s tactical depth and replayability. upgrades.

        - <SteamLink steam_id="1519490">*Doors of Trithius*</SteamLink>: A traditional roguelike blending retro-inspired aesthetics
        with deep tactical gameplay. The game features an expansive world map connecting procedurally generated
        dungeons, towns, and wilderness, offering
        players the freedom to explore a dynamic world.
        Its faction system introduces nuanced interactions, where alliances or rivalries can influence encounters and quests.
        With a robust class system, item-based progression, and unpredictable challenges, the game demands adaptability and
        tactical thinking.

        - <WikiLink wiki_id="Dungeon_Crawl_Stone_Soup">*Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (DCSS)*</WikiLink>: A quintessential example of a traditional roguelike that
        emphasizes grid-based movement, turn-based combat, and meaningful resource management. Its diverse character builds and
        procedurally generated dungeons challenge players to adapt their strategies on the fly, ensuring that no two runs feel
        the same.

        - <SteamLink steam_id="1036640">*Zorbus*</SteamLink>: A D&D-inspired traditional roguelike where the player explores a
        dynamic, sound-rich dungeon to reach the mythical Zorbus, recruiting allies and bypassing hunger/item-ID mechanics.
        A classless progression system lets players buy skills and talents (spells, combat maneuvers) per level, while
        creatures with d20-inspired AI loot items, rally allies, and react to light/sound.
        Themed zones (prisons, throne rooms) comprise a “live” dungeon where factions clash, torches flicker, and speech
        bubbles telegraph enemy intent.

        - <SteamLink steam_id="497800">Golden Krone Hotel</SteamLink>: A distinctive roguelike that innovates with its vampire-themed
        setting and dynamic mechanics.
        The game challenges players to navigate a procedurally generated hotel while managing the unique duality of human and
        vampire forms, each offering different abilities and tactical advantages.
        Dynamic lighting and potion mechanics introduce environmental interactions, where sunlight and shadows play a critical
        role in survival.

        - <WikiLink wiki_id="Brogue_(video_game)">*Brogue*</WikiLink>: With grid-based movement, turn-based combat, and
        procedurally generated dungeons, this open source game exemplifies classic roguelike design, with a heavy emphasis
        on environmental interactions, resource management, and emergent gameplay.
        Players must carefully navigate traps, utilize consumables strategically, and adapt to a variety of procedurally
        generated challenges.

        - <SteamLink steam_id="722730">*Cogmind*</SteamLink>: A salvage-driven customization roguelike where the player assembles
        robots from scavenged parts—weapons, propulsion systems, stealth modules—to shift between roles like tank-like
        brawlers, agile fliers, or stealth assassins. Combat employs a time-driven turn system: every action delays
        subsequent moves, allowing faster robots to act repeatedly before slower opponents. Combat is optional via evasion
        or hacking, with progression tied to area advancement rather than grinding. Between skirmishes, the player hacks
        terminals, manipulates enemies, recruits allies, and pieces together lore while adapting to dynamic loadouts
        (components break and require on-the-fly rebuilding).

        - <SteamLink steam_id="2720010">*Rogue Fable IV*</SteamLink>: A tactical roguelike where the player outmaneuvers enemies
        through terrain, dodging attacks, and chaining abilities (spells, dashes, ranged strikes) in turn-based skirmishes.
        Combat prioritizes skill as well as stats: with runs winnable via environmental mastery (cover, traps, clouds) and
        emergent synergies. An optional ranked mode randomizes enemy-boosting modifiers (e.g., buffed factions,
        new mechanics) for escalating challenges, while the base game balances accessibility with depth.

        - ### Modern Roguelikes: Case Studies
        - <SteamLink steam_id="811320">*Jupiter Hell*</SteamLink>: Blending the sci-fi setting of Doom with traditional roguelike mechanics,
        delivers turn-based tactical gameplay with a modern twist. Its
        clear interface and tactical pacing make every decision impactful, while its procedural design ensures consistent
        replayability.

        - <SteamLink steam_id="212680">*FTL: Faster Than Light*</SteamLink>: While not quite a traditional roguelike, this game
        embraces procedural generation, high-stakes decision-making, and resource management.
        Its real-time-with-pause mechanics balance tactical and strategic elements, offering a fresh interpretation of
        roguelike principles within a sci-fi framework. The developers refer to their game as a "roguelike-like", but in
        my opinion it qualifies as a modern roguelike.

        - <SteamLink steam_id="975370">*Dwarf Fortress (Adventure Mode)*</SteamLink>: Featuring procedural complexity, emergent
        storytelling, and high-stakes tactical play, the Adventure Mode offers a highly simulated world where players
        control a single character navigating dynamic environments. Interactions with factions, creatures, and environments
        lead to unpredictable, story-driven gameplay.

        - *Rift Wizard* <SteamLink steam_id="1271280">*1*</SteamLink> and <SteamLink steam_id="2058570">*2*</SteamLink>:
        A spell-casting roguelike where players craft builds from 100+ spells in short, tactical runs. No meta-progression;
        victory hinges on perfecting synergies within a single attempt. The sequel increases the complexity, expanding the
        formula with more dynamic spell-crafting, larger monsters, and a new equipment system. It retains the lack of
        meta-progression but introduces adaptive challenges requiring reactive build pivots.

        - <SteamLink steam_id="2128270">*Path of Achra*</SteamLink>: A dark fantasy roguelike where players craft “broken builds”
        through synergistic trait and skill combos, automating cascading ability chains in turn-based tactical combat.
        As a deity-bound pilgrim, the player traverses the landscape of Achra -- stripped of exploration --to reach a
        mysterious black obelisk, with combat-focused maps serving as backdrops for layered, puzzle-like skirmishes.
        Experimentation defines progression, as builds trigger dynamic ability sequences under specific conditions,
        rewarding strategic mastery over randomization.

        - ### Hybrid Roguelikes: Case Studies
        Hybrid roguelikes blend traditional roguelike mechanics with elements from other genres, creating unique gameplay
        experiences. These games often incorporate tactical decision-making while introducing innovations that set them apart
        from both conventional roguelikes and roguelites, placing them in a categorization gray area.

        The following non-exhaustive list provides some examples of hybrid roguelikes.

        - <SteamLink steam_id="975370">*Dwarf Fortress (Fortess Mode)*</SteamLink>: Combines traditional roguelike elements like procedural
        generation and emergent complexity with colony management and simulation mechanics. In Fortress Mode, players oversee
        the construction and operation of a sprawling settlement, managing resources, citizens, and external threats.
        The roguelike influence is evident in the unpredictability of events, the high stakes of decisions, and the emergent
        storytelling that arises from interactions between the environment, creatures, and dwarves. However, its focus on
        large-scale planning and indirect control over individual units places it firmly in the hybrid category, blending
        roguelike principles with a deep simulation experience.

        - <SteamLink steam_id="329970">*KeeperRL*</SteamLink>: With grid-based movement, turn-based mechanics, and a mix of
        roguelike and simulation elements, this game combines traditional dungeon-building mechanics with roguelike
        exploration and combat, allowing players to control both individual units and broader dungeon systems.

        - <SteamLink steam_id="243970">*Invisible, Inc.*</SteamLink>: Merges traditional roguelike elements, such as procedurally
        generated missions and turn-based tactical decision-making, with strategic team management features commonly found in
        strategy games like <WikiLink wiki_id="X-COM:_UFO_Defense">*XCOM*</WikiLink>. The game focuses on controlling a small
        team of agents, requiring players to manage resources, plan coordinated actions, and make strategic decisions at both
        the mission and operational levels.

        - <SteamLink steam_id="2692300">*Terminus: Zombie Survivors*</SteamLink>: Turn-based survival roguelike combining action
        point-driven movement and a modal combat system, where every ability (scavenging, attacking, fortifying) consumes
        shared AP. The player commands survivors through procedurally generated wastelands, balancing tactical skirmishes
        against undead hordes with long-term base-building and faction diplomacy, and with victory conditions.
        Meta-progression consists of as unlocking of new character classes.

        - ### Roguelites: Case Studies
        To illustrate this, consider the following sets of non-exhaustive examples:
        - Games that are real-time as opposed to turn-based are *action roguelites*.

        Examples include:

        -	<SteamLink steam_id="1145360">*Hades*</SteamLink>: Combines fast-paced combat with a deep narrative and persistent
        upgrades.
        -	<SteamLink steam_id="588650">*Dead Cells*</SteamLink>: Fuses platforming and hack-and-slash combat with unlockable
        weapons and abilities.
        -	*Rogue Legacy* <SteamLink steam_id="241600">1</SteamLink> and <SteamLink steam_id="1253920">2</SteamLink>:
        Features generational meta-progression, where each new character inherits traits and upgrades from previous
        runs. The sequel expands the formula with class-altering traits, biome-specific progression, and evolving
        relics, deepening the legacy-building mechanics.
        -	*Heroes of Hammerwatch* <SteamLink steam_id="677120">*1*</SteamLink> and <SteamLink steam_id="619820">*2*</SteamLink>:
        Blends action RPG mechanics with procedural generation and persistent town upgrades.
        -	<SteamLink steam_id="250900">Binding of Isaac</SteamLink>: Features fast-paced, reflex-heavy gameplay with
        incremental unlocks and item progression across runs.
        -   <WikiLink wiki_id="Spelunky">*Spelunky*</WikiLink> <SteamLink steam_id="239350">*1*</SteamLink> and
        <SteamLink steam_id="418530">*2*</SteamLink>: Incorporate roguelike
        randomness but rely on player reflexes and precise timing to navigate their environments.
        - <WikiLink wiki_id="Diablo_(video_game)">*Diablo*</WikiLink>: Leans heavily on action RPG mechanics, along with a
        rigid story and set pieces. Its use of randomization and high replayability align it with roguelite
        design principles.

        Action roguelites usually ditch the grid-based movement as well; turn-based action and grid-based movement are often
        closely correlated. However, the converse does not necessarily apply. There are plenty of games that do not use
        grid-based movement, and yet remain turn-based.

        - Games that do not use grid-based movements but retain the turn-based feature can be categorized based on the primary
        non-roguelike mechanic.
        E.g. Deck-Building, Dice-Placement, etc.

        Examples include:

        - <SteamLink steam_id="646570">*Slay the Spire*</SteamLink>: Turn-based **Deck-building** roguelite where the player
        climbs a branching spire via strategic path choices and card synergies.
        - <SteamLink steam_id="2579980">*Balatro*</SteamLink>: Poker-inspired **deck-building** roguelite where the player
        combines cards into combos while balancing risk/reward to defeat escalating challenges.
        - <SteamLink steam_id="861540">*Dicey Dungeons*</SteamLink>: Turn-based **Dice-placement** roguelite in which the
        player manipulates dice rolls and placements to activate and execute attacks, blending luck with strategy.
        - <SteamLink steam_id="1296610">*Peglin*</SteamLink>: Turn-based **Physics-based** roguelite in which the player
        ricochets orbs off pachinko boards to defeat foes, with upgrades altering orb physics and board layouts.

        - Games that focus on multiple rather than single characters are *squad-based roguelites*.

        Examples include:

        - <SteamLink steam_id="249050">*Dungeon of the Endless*</SteamLink>: Combines roguelike gameplay with tower defense.
        Players control a party of heroes working together to protect a crystal while exploring procedurally generated
        levels. Each hero has unique abilities that influence strategy.
        - <SteamLink steam_id="527230">*For the King*</SteamLink>: A turn-based strategy game with party-based exploration,
        combat, and survival. Players control a group of adventurers on a procedurally generated map, balancing risk
        and reward as they progress.

        - Games that implement meta-progression between runs are *advancement roguelites*.

        Examples include:
        - <SteamLink steam_id="1299780">*Warm Snow*</SteamLink>: A fast-paced action roguelite where players unlock
        permanent upgrades (e.g., skill trees, weapons, and passive abilities) between runs. These persistent
        enhancements allow for strategic power growth and customization, encouraging repeated attempts.
        - <SteamLink steam_id="1970580">*Backpack Hero*</SteamLink>: Centers on tactical inventory management, where the
        arrangement of items in your backpack directly affects gameplay. Between runs, players unlock new characters
        and mechanics that expand strategic possibilities and enhance replayability.

        #### Categorization
        It's important to realize that these categorizations aren't concrete or exclusive. Most of the games in the examples
        straddle boundaries between categories. For example, <SteamLink steam_id="241600">*Rogue Legacy*</SteamLink> would also
        be considered an *action roguelite*, and <SteamLink steam_id="1145360">*Hades*</SteamLink> is also an *advancement
        roguelite*.
