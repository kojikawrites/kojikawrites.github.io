## Cellular Automata

Back when I was working on some of the concepts and tooling in C#, there was a need to explore a wide range of
techniques for procedurally generating various aspects of a game. One of the most fascinating methods (and one that
grabbed my attention after seeing [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) running
in 32×22 resolution on the ZX81) is Cellular Automata (CA).

In other words, Cellular Automata are a class of algorithms that generate complex, emergent phenomena by applying simple
rules repeatedly to a (usually) 2D grid. For example, the rules for Conway's Game of Life are as follows:

1. All live cells not affected by subsequent rules die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Conway's Life is probably the most famous CA. Among Roguelike developers, however, the use of CAs for generating maps
of [cave layouts](https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/Cellular_Automata_Method_for_Generating_Random_Cave-Like_Levels)
is well known. Similarly, the original [SimCity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_(1989_video_game)) relied on
CA-like rules to govern city growth.

### Custom DSL for CAs

Given the usefulness of CAs in procedural generation, there was an interest in a straightforward way to experiment with
different rules without writing disposable code each time. With that in mind, a custom scripting language was created to
handle common operations for running CAs.

Obviously, the first test was Conway’s Game of Life. Here is the script written in that custom DSL:


```c
// Space Definition.
SPACE:
{
	// need to define space, connectivity, dimensions.
	Size: (128, 128);
	Wrap: True;
	Neighbors:
	{
		N:	( 0, -1);
		S:	( 0,  1);
		W:	(-1,  0);
		E:	(+1,  0);
		NE: (+1, -1);
		SE: (+1, +1);
		NW: (-1, -1);
		SW: (-1, +1);
	};
	States:
	{
		off; // default OOB state always comes first.
		on;
	}
};

// random init
INIT(on,0.45|off, (*,*))

// 1. All live cells not affected by subsequent rules die in the next generation.
// Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
//
// 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
//
// 3. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

// These three rules can be condensed into the slightly more efficient:
// (a) Set all next generation cells to dead.
DEFAULT(off);

// (b) If a cell has three live neighbors, set it live, and move on to the next cell.
IF (NEIGHBORS(on) == 3)
{
	SET (on);
	BREAK;
}

// (c) If a cell is live and it has two neighbors, set it live and move to the next cell
IF (CELL(on) AND NEIGHBORS(on) == 2)
{
	SET (on);
}
```

### Explanation of the DSL
The `SPACE` section defines parameters such as the size of the grid, whether it wraps around at the edges, neighbor
coordinates, and the states each cell can take. Following that is the `INIT` statement, which randomizes the grid to a
specified ratio of `on` (45%) and `off` (55%).

The CA rules run once per step across each cell in the grid:

- `DEFAULT(off)` sets all cells not modified by subsequent rules to the `off` state.
- The first `IF` condition sets the state of a cell to `on` if it has exactly three neighbors, and then stops processing.
- The final `IF` ensures that cells remain in the `on` state if they had exactly two neighbors in the previous time-step.

These checks rely on the previous time-step's state of the grid rather than any updates already made in the current iteration.
In practice, this is done using front-buffer and back-buffer flipping: values are read from the current front buffer and
written to the back buffer. After processing each cell, the buffers are flipped so the new state becomes visible.

Even though this script looks more verbose than a [rulestrings](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Rulestring) approach, it is
more flexible and extensible while still handling the key details. The typical Game of Life rulestring, `B3/S23`, can be
translated directly into the script above (`B3` = a dead cell becomes alive with exactly 3 neighbors, `S23` = a living
cell remains alive with 2 or 3 neighbors).

### Visualizing the CA

I also wrote a quick-and-dirty visualizer tool, that looked like this:

<LightboxGallery>
    <GalleryEntry src="/src/assets/images/hiivelabs.com/blog/ca/ca-editor.png"
                  alt="Script editor on the left with CA simulation output on the right."
                  description="A screenshot demonstrating a custom DSL script for Conway’s Game of Life on the left,
                  with a black-and-white real-time visualization of the evolving pattern on the right. A console panel
                  displays 'No errors,' confirming the simulation has run successfully."/>
    <GalleryEntry src="/src/assets/images/hiivelabs.com/blog/ca/ca-editor-glider.png"
                  alt="Script editor on the left, simulation output on the right, highlighting a glider with a red circle."
                  description="A code editor on the left features a DSL for Conway’s Game of Life. On the right, white cells evolve
                  against a dark background over multiple generations. The cluster of five cells circled in red forms a
                  glider, a pattern that moves diagonally across the grid." />

The following zoomed-in image shows a generated glider.

               description="A zoomed-in look at a small, self-propagating cluster of cells known as a glider,
               traveling diagonally through the grid in a repeating cycle."/>

### Other Popular CA Rules
Two well-known variations for generating pseudo-mazes are Maze (`B3/S12345`) and Mazectric (`B3/S1234`). The main
distinction between the two is that Mazectric tends to produce longer corridors.
Only the relevant script excerpts are shown here.

### Maze (B3/S12345)
This is the output from the Maze rulestring after 10 generations.

              alt="Maze-like structure generated by the B3/S12345 rules"
              description="A ten-generation snapshot of a Maze CA, showcasing winding corridors and branching pathways
              formed using the B3/S12345 ruleset."/>

### Mazeectric (B3/S1234)
Mazectric, shown below, similarly generates maze-like structures but emphasizes elongated corridors:

               description="A ten-generation snapshot of the Mazectric CA, generated by the B3/S1234 ruleset.
               It highlights longer, more winding passages than the standard Maze variant."/>


### Cave Network (B5678/S45678)
The following example is `B5678/S45678`, which produces decent cave layouts, especially if the initial distribution of
live and dead cells is near 50/50. Further post-processing -- like flood-filling disconnected regions and connecting
them -- creates more polished results.

<LightboxImage src="/src/assets/images/hiivelabs.com/blog/ca/ca-cave.png"
               alt="Cave-like terrain produced by the B5678/S45678 rules."
               description="A 10-generation view illustrating how the B5678/S45678 CA ruleset creates sprawling caves.
               Although this ruleset unecessarily references the maximum number of neighbors (mirroring the rulestring’s format),
               it still yields a substantial cave network suitable for further post-processing"/>

For example, the following mock-up shows large regions colored via flood fill, roughened edges, elimination of interior
pockets, and potential connections between cave sections (shown in red). This particular post-processing was done
manually, but could be automated in many cases.

               description="A cave layout with color-coded regions and eliminated interior pockets. Red lines
               indicate suggested connections between separate areas, creating a more cohesive overall map."/>


### Converting the Scripting Language
The current version of this CA scripting language is written in C#. A primary coding theme in my posts has been
converting existing code to Rust. The language already supports multiple dimensions, arbitrary neighborhood definitions,
and various states (including preliminary support for continuous states).


Recently, an indie game developer, [Loren Schmidt](https://bsky.app/profile/lorenschmidt.bsky.social), has been doing
impressive work using CAs to generate landscapes and cityscapes for a roguelike. Following their progress on Bluesky
reignited an interest in revisiting the existing CA codebase to see if it could support more advanced CAs. As of now,
it cannot, so there is room for improvements during the Rust conversion.

In particular, Loren’s work (they also have a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/vacuumflowers) that is well worth supporting
if you're interested in CAs), got me thinking about how far CA research has come from 2D discrete grids.
There has been significant development around continuous-space CAs, such as [Lenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenia).
Lenia implements multichannel, multidimensional continuous space and time CAs, using techniques like convolution
kernels to define neighbor relationships.

<LightboxImage src="/src/assets/images/hiivelabs.com/blog/ca/ca-lenia.png"
               alt="Lenia CA visualization with smoothly evolving patterns."
               description="An example of Lenia, a continuous-space cellular automaton framework. It demonstrates
               how multichannel, multidimensional CAs can produce fluid and organic behaviors over time."/>

### Toward More Flexible Kernels

Adopting convolution kernels could make the scripting language more modular. It means there should be a straightforward
but versatile way to define these kernels. A good approach might be to include a few commonly used kernels that can be
parameterized to suit different needs, while still allowing extensibility for new kernels.

Support for the succinct “rulestring” style could also be retained, but it remains highly specific to discrete CAs.
Any extension into continuous domains would require a careful approach so as not to become overly complex.

### Next Steps
Large codebases can make it easy to lose focus, especially when switching languages. While writing usually reflects
highlights, there is significant “drudge work” involved behind the scenes. This post is different in that most of the
planned work is still underway, so it is more speculative.

As of yesterday, the parser part of the scripting language has been more or less converted to Rust, building an abstract
syntax tree (AST). Implementation is about one-third done, focusing first on the `SPACE` section. Instead of Antlr
(used in the C# version), this Rust version uses Pest, which behaves differently enough to require careful rethinking
of the parser.

To avoid going off on tangents, contact has been made with Loren Schmidt for insights into the CA features they need.
Ideally, if the scripting language can comfortably support both of our use cases, it should handle in-game needs and
more. Loren has offered to share some of their work for testing, which will likely guide further improvements.

Another area of interest is how to run different generation scripts on different areas of the same space while handling
boundary interactions. For instance, one might want a procedurally generated cave to merge into a procedurally generated
dungeon or cellar. This blending of techniques (CAs or otherwise) is crucial for expansive procedural worlds.
Addressing it will require careful planning in the CA scripting language conversion and enhancement process.
